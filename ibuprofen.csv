review
"I get frequent headaches. By frequent, I mean I’ll get at least one every day. I’ve tried a lot of pain relief methods, but not one method or medicine has worked the way Advil has. Advil is a godsend. I’ve been using it when needed for years now. It’s truly the work of the heavens. It clears up my headache in a half hour maximum. For me, I get no side effects that others talk about (nausea, queasiness, diarrhea, etc.) and it works perfectly. I truly couldn’t imagine a more perfect medicine for pain and fever relief in my life. I recommend this medicine and nothing else for pain."
it helped my cramps go for a couple of hours but a little while after I took it I fell asleep...
"I've had dehabilitating period pain since I started my periods at  11 years old. I get weak and have painful cramps, can't function. Feels like having a miscarriage every time. Taking 800mg ibuprofen doesn't touch my pain. Midol is the only thing that helps. Until I was recently put on the generic form of mobic. This has been a high relief for me. I started at 11 years old, and am 43 now. I don't like taking it everyday, but it was prescribed for arthritis and has been a life saver!!!"
Advil works great for inflammation and pain but has anybody experience blood vessels breaking under the skin after long term use? If I scratch my arm over my clothes it will make a horrible spot. It only happens on my arms so weird.
Doesnt work at all for severe cramps :(((
"As much as I don’t like taking medications (I just feel like it’s not good for your kidneys and it’s not natural), I suffer from very painful period cramps every month. I tried using other remedies but TBH none of them work (even for weed). I normally feel very weak on my first day of period and I almost can’t feel any blood in my limbs. Pain killers like advil works well and I felt like I was normal again. Would recommend it."
"My lower spine was injured in a car accident.  The L-3 was crushed, resulting in paralysis in one leg.  I also developed Crohn’s disease.  After using ibuprofen for months, I developed symptoms of stomach ulcers so I stopped taking it,  and within a day the feelings of being either hot or cold completely disappeared.  I can now sleep thru the night without waking up hot and sweaty.  I would also experience episodes of feeling extremely cold, oftentimes soon after feeling extremely hot.  I would put on extra clothing, go to bed with extra blankets until I finally warmed up.  These two symptoms went on for months, but has now completely stopped, shortly after stopping the Ibuprophen."
Ring finger was pulsing with pain it worked in about 20 min I have to go back to get a x ray but working good my pain was originally at an 8 and I'm at a 2 now
"This is my first time in a while taking this. I usually stick to naproxens but I wanted to go a diff route.  So far so good I'm having slight pain but not as bad as before.  Fingers, eyes, legs, arms toes are all crossed  . .hoping this works thru out my day :*)"
"I have mild sciatica pain from time to time but after picking up my 25 pound granddaughter during a recent visit, and pulling a muscle in my hip, I developed sciatica so painful I literally could not sit down. My doctor suggested ice and heat and an Advil regimen. I started taking two Advil three times a day (200 mg tablets) and did this for six days. The pain just didn’t diminish. My doctor then prescribed a muscle relaxer so I started taking it while continuing with the Advil. Still no real improvement. I decided to stop the Advil as my son-in-law told me it was not good to take too much of it for a lengthy time. Well, after 24 hours of not taking the Advil I felt so much better!! I’m able to actually sit in a chair with no pain! I don’t know if the Advil was interfering with the muscle relaxer (baclofen) or whether it simply had not ever worked for me and I didn’t realize it."
"IMPORTANT: TAKE ANY PAINKILLER THE DAY BEFORE EXPECTED CRAMPS!!! I have found all pain medication to be much more likely to be effective this way. If pain already exists, it doesnt normally seem to do much of anything. I just suffer in agony for hours, sometimes on and off all day long due to severe symptoms. I don't know why that would be, but there you have it. Even hours after taking any painkiller, I tend to feel little to no relief if I havent pre-dosed."
"I am pretty big ibuprofen taker and never had problems with ibuprofen ever. I tried major brand after PA prescribed three 200mg every 6 hours. the pharmacy gave me this brand, and upon taking first dose found I felt extremely horrible and was having a severe strokish allergic reaction. Most horrible experience truly."
"My period is extremely painful. I have to take 800mg  ibuprofen 3 times a day to get relief. Sometimes even 800mg doesn't work if I don't catch it early. Starts working around 40-60 mins, Sometimes later. But If it really kicks in, I feel great for like 6-8 hrs. I have to laugh when somebody explain their cramps as horrible, but then say 1-2 pills a day save them. Girls you are so lucky"
"I have chronic migraines and my Dr prescribed me 800mg of Ibuprofen 3 times a day or as needed AND LET ME TELL YOUUUUU... Within 5 mins my migraine literally MELTS AWAY. I can't live without it, it really helps my condition."
"In an eight hour period, I'd take 1600mgs of ibuprofen and not feel an improvement"
It really works for my periods. I have terrible cramps at  this time of the month. I cannot live without this medicine.
A lot off people such as myself haven been to the Dentist get a wisdom tooth pulled and I'm looking for something to reduce/stop the pain and ibuprofen SUCKS like I never even took anything... The pain swallows the pill.
"I use ibuprofen  when my period gets heavy 
And when I have cramps 
It’s makes it less 
(That what my dad told me he is a pharmacist:) )"
Been there done that. I've tried everything there is to offer for tooth pain with zero results. I have a huge hole in a lower wisdom tooth as we speak. When waiting to get in to the poor man's dentist it can take a month or more. (Based on income) I have 2 more weeks and I am counting down the minutes. 
"Ibuprofen Is like taking candy, it does nothing for severe pain and I was on the 800mg prescription dose in addition it's not good for your stomach."
I had my wisdom teeth out and was in agonizing pain. I took a 600mg tablet of ibuprofen with 1 extra strength tylenol as they instructed and it got me through it. Highly recommend. Just don't overdo it.
I have horrible period cramps and I take ibuprofen every five hours or so for around two days when my cramps are intense and it really works.  I couldn't live without it.
"I was taken kicking and screaming off of Norco 10/325 x 6 daily and put on buprenorphine 2 mgs. twice a daily and ibufrofen (Advil) 200 mgs. as needed.  I did not realize the side effects from the Norco were so bad until I stopped it (severe itching, severe intestinal cramping, constant watching the clock waiting until my next dose).  I have lumbar stenosis and severe pain in my left foot.  The buprenorphine keeps it down to a level 3-5 most of the time and when it gets bad just one 200 mg OTC Advil knocks it back to 1-3.  I have yet to experience stomach upset at this low dose.  I wouldn't have believed it if you told me either.  Incredibly effective for an OTC pain reliever."
"This is the go to medicine for me for a frozen shoulder.  I was given Meloxicam first, but I couldn’t handle the side effects of muscle pain and insomnia.  I started the ibuprofen three days after stopping the Meloxicam, and the pain relief and stiffness were greatly relieved.  I take 400 mg a day, and no more, because that’s what works for me.  If I do take more, I become restless with no added pain relief, so why bother."
"TAKES AWAY everything super fast. It took away my pain, fever, and headache and suprisingly my stuffy nose. It always works"
Will not my  help brutal menstrual cramps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am working in hospital and suddenly I had a headache and felt heavy at the same time. So went to the pharmacy ask me to give me a tablet to relief headache and heaviness this was what they gave me and it was great
"I've been taking Advil liquid gel caps for years for the relief of migraines.  The last couple of years I've been developing itching scalp that followed with swollen eyes, lips and tongue.  I thought at first it was something I was eating or coming in contact with.  I never suspected it to be my Advils since I've been taking them for years and these reactions kind of new.  I've been paying close attention to what I do and eat and I found that it was most definitely the Advils that were causing these side effects which often sent me to the emergency  when my tongue would swell.  I just wanted to share this experience cause it took me 2yrs to figure the cause of my itchy scalp, swollen eyes, lips and tongue that would last for two days for swelling to reduce."
Please note that gastric bypass patients must stop all use of Ibuprofen and Aleve forever as  they are harmful to your pouch and create ulcers. I just was hospitalized for my Ibuprofen use as it caused a hole in my pouch.
"I have awful menstrual pain, and if I don't do anything about  it, I lie in bed all day, vomiting and writhing in pain. Advil liquid gels are the only medication that totally relieve my pain, and it does so within minutes!!! Without advil liquid gels, I wouldn't be able to function, and would need to take time off work. Thank you advil liquid gels, you are my saviour!!!"
"Ibuprofen certainly seems to reduce the pain in my back, and has been very effective in eliminating pain in my toothache. But it can (mildly) upset my stomach, especially if I take it without food. Even if taken with food, My Stomach can feel 'strange' and feel as if something is irritating it. It's hard to properly describe. I could be imagining it. There is increased intestinal (loud) rumbling and other noises as well. Still, it seems to work where paracetamol is totally ineffective."
It sucks
"For my period I’m taking usually between 400-500 mg of ibuprofen and it usually helps. I take it after I eat.
Works between 15-30 minutes and stays for 6-8 hours.
Highly recommend.
Also found in liquid medicine if (like me) you can’t take pills.

I am highly overweight and 500mg is usually enough .
Not recommended taking more than 1800mg if I remember correctly a day."
Advil works extremely well for toothache.  I was taking prescription Ibuprofen 600 and they don't work as well or as fast as original advil in my opinion.  Starts to work 15-30 mins after taking 3 for me.  This is an infected tooth that needed a root canal or is going to eventually be pulled.  I keep advil in my purse and will discontinue use after I have the procedure. Very pleased at how it stops extreme pain.  A godsend!
"I have osteoarthritis of the  temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and tinnitus. The ibuprofen helped with the pain initially, but it increased the tinnitus over time. It was great short-term, but not good long-term. If you have tinnitus (ringing of the ears), I would suggest not taking it or other NSAIDS."
"Ibuprofen has been my first line of treatment for gout attacks for 30 years and always works quick and fast.  If I take Ibuprofen during the week for normal aches and pains it also seems to prevents attacks.  Every time a doctor has instructed to me stop taking ibuprofen before or after a procedure I wind up having a gout attack.  If I can't take the ibuprofen or any other NSAID then I have used Colchicine, it works but I get serious nausea and diarrhea after one day.  I get quick and complete relief from methylprednisolone steroid pack."
This made my stomach hurt bad
I’ve always turned to ibuprofen when I have headaches. It tends to help me by removing the headache in the first place. I recommend you buy the Walmart brand (Equate) because it’s  a good generic brand and it works really well.
I’ve tried multiple medications yet the only two that ever help is Ibuprofin and Cortizone injections.  All I need to take is 200-400mg ibuprofin per day.
"I dont know why the rating for this medication is so low , unless it is because people just haven't tried it in which case I would highly recommend doing so. These are my go-to , the liquid medicine means it works faster and though you can't cure tooth pain fast enough , I can always count on these taking the edge off ..I don't bother taking anything else !"
Tried using Advil pm due to fibromyalgia pain and wasn't able to sleep. However I probably would have slept better if I didn't take anything because not only did it not help me sleep it failed to take any of the  slightest pain away
I gave it 5 stars only because it really did help me with my pain from pleurisy. I take one 800mg tablet every 6 hours when it flares up. But with long term usage (sometimes my flare ups last two weeks) I have noticed that I have felt extreme depression. Almost to the point where I see no reason to continue on. I didn't realize it was the medicine until someone else shared their story of ibuprofen with me. It had also made them depressed. So I immediately stopped taking it and within a few days was back to my old self. So moral of the story is that if you need to take ibuprofen please make sure you are doing it under a doctors supervision. Depression is not fun especially when you are in pain.
It is like baby aspirin for extreme pain. It doesn't touch bursitus or torn muscle. Take about an hour to even feel a little relief.
"I have been taking ibuprofen and gabapentin for two months. I have decided to take just ibuprofen because of the side effects of gabapentin, but I am leary of the reports of heart attacks from ibuprofen. Anyone with information on this?"
Works within half  hour but wears off within 4.
"I get varying types of headaches; migraine, stress, tension, sinus. Ibuprofen works most of the time but tends to take a while to work. And if taken on an empty stomach, will make you nauseous. I recommend using the gel-caps, as they seem to be softer on the stomach."
"I used to take Advil for headaches years ago. I must have taken a lot of it, because I had many headaches.  It worked great at the time. Now I have micro colitis which can be caused from taking to much of this NSAIDS. I really wish Google was around back in the day when I was popping all those Advil! I wouldn't be in the situation I'm in now with my stomach problems!"
I've found that taking ibuprofen (200 mg) several times daily reduces the shoulder and upper arm pain (both shoulders) and permits more flexibility. The length of time that its effect lasts is perhaps five or six hours at most...not quite long enough to get a full night's comfortable sleep.
"Had it recommended by the chemist rather than codeine
I didn't think anything worked for a toothache but ibuprofen worked for me 2 tabs for start then 1 when it wares off about 6 hours, while waiting for the dentist appointment."
I only take when needed but helps the pain alot.
"I bought the New Advil minis and they stink, They did nothing for my back pain as the originals did. I took 2 gels at once and they usually work right away, but these minis did nothing. I don't believe there is 200mg in each one as they say. Why change something that works, they lost my business..I hope others test it and let everyone know if they worked for them."
I've had bad period cramps since I started menstruating. I used ibuprofen but 400 mg every four to six hours was not enough; I was afraid to take more until I read the prescription dosage for arthritis was as high as 3200 mg per day. I bumped my dosage up to 600 mg per dose and that made a huge difference. I recommend talking to a doctor or pharmacist about how much to take if the typical dose isn't working for you.
Seriously worked better than the Percoset given to me at the hospital. I hurt my back but needed to go to work and couldn't be loopy. Lasts about 6 hrs then pain started to kick in again.. then took the OxyContin and broke out in hot sweats and nesusea... other one was way better
"This drug works wonders. I got all 4 wisdom teeth extracted two days ago and on the first night I had no pain but the second night at around 4:00 am I started getting the worst pain I've ever felt that kept me from sleeping. The first thing I thought of was ibuprofen. I quickly went downstairs to get some. I'm 5'3 and 120 lbs, I took four 200 mg pills as prescribed. It took less than 30 mins to kick in and once it did I felt no pain at all and fell asleep perfectly fine and comfortable. Thankyou very much Stewart Adams for inventing this drug. It's simple but miraculous. Sincerely, Sarah Craig"
"Extra strength (400 mg) liqui-gels are the only thing that seems to help with my sciatica. They do more than the Lyrica, delayed release naproxen, Tylenol 2's, and Extra Strength Tylenols combined. I take a high dose but  do not want to take narcotics and I have to be able to leave a half-way normal life."
"I have been an avid user of ibuprofen until this month 6/2017.  It worked wonders for my sciatic nerve pain until it stopped working and seemed to make my pain worse.  I found out I had an extreme vitamin D deficiency of 9 (normal range 30-100).  I started reading about the side effects and found I had several of them to include elevated liver enzymes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure.  The ibuprofen that I thought was helping actually depleted my vitamin D which is in a case study for my age group 47 and long term use of anti inflammatorys is been known to deplete vitamin D.  Vitamin D deficiency can be cause by long term use of ibuprofen and can cause muscle and bone pain."
good for me
Within 10-15 min pain is gone. I suffer from chronic headaches/migraines my whole life.......it's my life saver. It's my best friend
"Works better than Tylenol or Aspirin for pain and headache.  If I take 800mg within 30mins of the start of a headache, it'll almost always stops it."
"I took 400 mg  every 6 to 8 hours ibuprofen in the hospital for chest pain caused by radiation for breast cancer.  Since coming home from the hospital after four days, I am now reducing to one 200 mg tablet every 6 to 8 hours. Will taper off in the next couple of days. It has really worked wonders for the terrible pain in my chest."
Good
"Neurontin 800 mg 3 x a day. Helps me with Aleve. I could not walk, now I can with cane.plus a muscle relaxer 2x a day. Thanks"
"I have severe sciatica that is absolutely devastating to my lifestyle. I drive a lot and the pain is excruciating. 800mg of Ibuprofen provides relief in about an hour to an hour and a half and from a dose to pain returning is about 3 to 3 and a half hours. It's not much, but it's the only think giving me a respite from what is otherwise excruciating pain. I'm starting to get routine heartburn for the first time in years after taking this routinely for three months. Starting to worry about the stomach side effects. Can also be hard on the kidneys."
"Poor!

Obviously a male must've been the person the person behind the making of these tablets because they are poor! Too mild. 

When a woman takes painkillers for menstrual pains, it means they don't want to feel anything! But these tabs don't eradicate the pain like other regular pains do. In face, nurofen plus is far much better than the one for menstrual pains. I just think this was another way to expand their product line in the market to increase their customer base and profits! 

Nurofen guys, relook at it please!"
Always take this pain pills is the ONLY ONE works for me and I visited to many doctors office and change medication but always back to advil because is more safe to take this compare to the doctor prescription.
Have taken this tablet on 2 different occasions. Both times does not work for periods. I have horrible pains and i feel that this tablet does nothing at all. Id recommend something stronger for those who dont get mild cramps.
"Advil is my pain reliever of choice, and I take it occasionally to relieve severe headaches; however, it is not without its (many) faults. For starters, it often takes as long as 2 hours to start acting. Also, it is VERY hard on my stomach—taking even the smallest recommended dose makes me feel queasy and nauseous. I actually prefer the children's Advil, as it has a similar pain-relieving effect without as much stomach pain.

Overall, Advil is a worthwhile pain medication, but I would recommend using it sparingly."
"Wow. Started to get some major symptoms of TMJ this morning. I've never had to deal with it until today. The ibuprofen (Advil) did an amazing job at reducing the pain and discomfort. Granted, any medication that deals with TMJ helps temporarily and the root cause will need to be addressed. I believe that since my night guard got bent slightly and that I grind my teeth, the possible change in bite with the night-guard and overall grinding contributed. Having the dentist readjust my mouth guard should help do the job. A warm compress also helped me as well."
"I get frequent headaches that I would describe as a painful tightening of the muscles in the back of my neck on the sides of the spine, right at the bottom of the skull. It's usually centered there but the pain can radiate to the top of my head

If I take Ibuprofen early enough I can take 3 pills (600mg) but if it's a full blown headache I have to take 4 or 5 depending on the severity. If I swallow the pills whole it can take as long as 45 minutes to work. But pro-tip: you can chew them (unless it is the slow release form). They don't taste bad and they will work a little faster.

Great medication. I don't know what I'd do without it. Came here to learn the maximum dose per day. Have not noticed any bad side effects."
Currently experiencing torn cartilage in my jaw after having my bottom impacted wisdom teeth pulled. The on call surgeon suggested these as well as the leftover oxycodine from my surgery. The tear happened about 8:35 this evening. Since then I've taken 3 oxycodine and 4 ibuprofen 800mg and nothing is taking away the pain. They did the job for the pain after surgery. But unfortunately nothing is doing it now.
Didn't work for me. Made my stomach and head hurt. I was taking it for an ovarian cyst. I had to stick with Tylenol 3 instead.
"Excellent anti-inflammatory/NSAID. Worked well on a sprained big toe that caused swelling in that area. It works better than the store brand generic. I know people claim they are the same, but I can tell the difference."
"I have used Advil (Ibuprofen) for over a year for most headaches. It works like a charm, better than any other medicine I've tried, even ones previous doctors have recommended (my current one does recommend Advil). When I was a kid, I used the children's Advil (chewable), and it still worked great. It didn't taste like grease, unlike most other children's medicine I had. Now as an adult, I still love it. I've never experienced any side effects, nor have I ever had any negative reactions to it. It starts kicking in super quickly, and the headaches don't tend to come back after I take a tablet of Advil. Overall highly recommended, not too pricey (especially for the amount of drug in each capsule and for the number of capsules in a container)."
"I have taken midol, Advil, but none compare to Motrin IB. It worked within the first five minutes of me taking it. Great for instant relief, and last quite a while."
The best pain reliever choice for me!
"800 mg helped with my pain. It takes about an hour to work then pain is manageable. I have minimal side effects, a little headachy and slightly tired. I can take this and get relief without feeling drugged."
"I took 600 MG of this medication for a mild to moderate knee sprain, and it made it tolerable to bear weight. It reduces inflammation, which is good for minor injuries. I would highly recommend this for short term use, as it's over the counter and not sedating. It works pretty fast, too."
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS. Took this medication at 5 am when I woke up with a headache. Took an advil extra strength. Shortly after, I was puking my guts up for like an hour. I had an exam that morning too. Needless to say, I failed my exam. Thank you advil. I do not recommend this."
"I am having a severe dysmenorrhea each and every of my menstrual days. That's why I tried ibuprofen, specifically Advil, as it was also suggested by my friends.  But before I took this, I consulted my doctor. He gave me specific dosages. Now, my menstrual cramps are gone."
Not great for your gut long term
"Awful, to say the least. Don't even consider this if you have anything more than a headache, and even that won't be tolerable after taking a few of these."
I had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  I had an allergic reaction to naproxen so I started taking Motrin and It was very effective.  I have been in remission for about 18 years now.
This helped with my shoulder pain.
It did not help at all and actually made my whiplash a lot more painful
"Does nothing for my migraines,tylenol works much better"
"Took an 800 mg with food. Severe gas, heart burn, vomiting and diarrhea. It's been 24 hours and my stomach is still in excruciating pain. Never again"
didn't do much for my headaches
This is really good
"This works very well for me, and needless to say is readily available.  The trick is knowing when to take one or when to take two."
Great for short time use
I was in the hospital and the nurse gave me this medication and it woked really good I have used day quill ibuprofen and many more medication and Motrin worked the best
"I recently got braces, the pain quickly started and lasted long. Luckily, I took Advil and the pain has subsided."
"I suffer with endometriosis. Due to this the pain is brutal. I have tried most everything under the sun for relief. I highly recommend ADVIL LIQ-GELS, for fast relief with little stomach upset."
"Ibuprofen was my default pain relief early in my experience with Ankylosing Spondylitis. It reduced inflammation and made the pain, discomfort and stiffness more manageable. 

I did experience some side effects (constipation, followed by diarrhea due to the blockage, stomach pains etc., but the pain management helped to make it bearable. I managed on it for over 10 years before my fusion made the pain worse."
Gels are better and work faster than the tablet form.
"Been taking ibuprofen 800 3x a day, and always with food.  A PA urged me to go off of it last Mon (now Wed) and replace with tramadol; said he didn't know anyone who didn't get stomach ulcers or have kidney problems when on ibuprofen for extended period.   Each day pain grew worse until today I could hardly get out of bed as pain was excruciating.  Cooked breakfast in a hurry, switched back to ibuprofen and now pain free by noon"
"Been having costochondritis and the pain and swelling were increasing. After taking ibuprofen pain has decreased but noticed that my appetite has drastically changed, I'm craving everything i see and that made me gain weight. Which is weird for me because i have always been fit. Going to start taking ibuprofen right before i go to sleep to see how it works out."
I take 1 200mg ibuprofen before bedtime. It helps me sleep and I don't wake up with any stiffness in the morning or during the next day. It lasts for 24hrs.
"My son is sick with Influenza B. Last night his fever skyrocketed above 104, he vomited, wouldn't move, eat, or talk, I was terrified. I called the doctor and he recommended Children's Ibuprofen. Within an hour of taking it he was asleep, I give it every 6 hours and today he is 100 percent better, playing and even eating. I can't believe how well it works!"
"Long term migraine sufferer. First used Axert twice, still had burning, Advil Migraine relieved the burning. Only one day , but seems like it is worth a try."
"I purchased this medicine for my little girl because it was doctor recommended. It was a need base purchase to reduce her fever and some of the discomfort that she was having. They stated that it would be the best in reducing her fever. I purchased the medicine and shortly after her fever was gone and she was resting. She slept well through the night. Children%u2019s Motrin is a name that I trust. Therefore, I was not hesitant at all when my doctor recommended that I purchase this product. I have also used other fever reducer products for my little one, such as Tylenol and it did not reduce her fever at all, so Motrin was the choice brand. Motrin allowed her to sleep through the night and she did not spike a fever the next day. Motrin did the job."
"I've been suffering from headaches/migraines due to stress, menstrual cramps and dry sinuses for 5 years now and I have to say Motrin is very amazing with results. I would usually take 2 to 3 pills with food and about an hour or 2 it takes the pain away. No side effects!"
"My tonsils have been hurting very badly the whole day that I felt like crying. 10 minutes after taking Advil, I felt such a relief. More than half of the pain was gone and I was able to take my final exams for school without any pain. Thank you so much Advil!"
Didn't help much.
Relieves pain faster but not quite like a narcotic...safer! 8.5 to a 9 out of 10 for 800mgs does the job!!
"I have chronic gout problems, been having for 15 years. Advil works good for my back pain and most of the time for joint pain if taken at the first feeling of gout flare. Taking four 200mg caps at a time."
I would suggest taking Naproxen rather than Ibuprofen for this.  500 mg of Naproxen works.  I have tried both and Naproxen is superior.  Ibuprofen does nothing for me.
"I've been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) since 1999 for headaches and body pains. I sometimes take this with the prescription medication Maxalt (which treats migraines) I've have REALLY bad headaches and migraines since I was in grade school and took Tylenol until when into my late 20's. I then started taking the regular 2 tablet dose, 400 mg. I HAVE on occasion upped the dosage (not on doctors instruction) to 600mg if the 400mg dosage isn't effective and the pain doesn't not subside within 30-45 minutes."
"I'm starting to have pain in 2 of my fingers on my right hand, and I know that my family history has arthritis, so by taking 800mgs of Advil, it seems to take away the pain. I also found that putting heat on it, helps the pain also."
I take the 800 mg tablet for pain and have for twenty years with very good results.
It's good.
"Ibuprofen is wonderful for period pain, takes an hour to work and I take 2 x 200mg tablets every 8 hours.  Have been taking ibuprofen for a few years now and it's always done the job so far, until this week that is. I was admitted to hospital with an immune system that almost shut down because of a reaction to ibuprofen.  I consider myself very lucky that I did a routine blood test and found out this information, was told to stop taking the medicine immediately.  Please be careful even if you've taken this medicine on a number of other occasions as I have done."
"A soon as I took it I started having blurry images, I couldn't breathe and everything turned for the worse. I feel like everything that surrounds me are circling or rolling."
Definitely relieves my headache.
Beats  Acetaminophen
Works okay but causes upset stomach.
"Ibuprofen 600/ or 800 is a great pain reliever. Although I've taken many pain medicines over the years, ibuprofen I find to be just as effective as the strong control substances. It's a good anti-inflammatory too. Works great for severe menstrual cramps and tooth pain as well."
It worked fast.
"I always take these pills when I have my period, and it usually takes away the pain within an hour or so, but I do not recommend you take ibuprofen without eating first as I have done in the past, not such a good idea."
I was prescribed this medicine for a tooth infection and had serious bad pain. Took one 600mg and I was all good except sleepy. 
"I have severe hip flexor pain, and my doctor recommended this. It did nothing for it. "
Seems to help back pain. Good for headaches.
"Had bought 200mg Ibuprofen over the counter today at the pharmacy while receiving my medications. Never did think too much of Tylenol and always did hear the horror stories of Tylenol and liver failure growing up, so as I've become an adult I've weaned towards Ibuprofen. I had a killer headache and took only one 200mg Ibuprofen. Great relief; my headache is long gone. "
Better than any other NSAID but when you have serious pain you will need something a little stronger.
The pain was in my back for some odd reason instead of my stomach and it was gone about 20-30 minutes after I took the Advil. I could feel nothing for about two hours.
When I have trouble sleeping I can take one Advil and sleep all night.  I also use Advil when I have pains in my muscles or back from exercising too much.
"I have used Advil to treat my gout for years.  I start off with 3 when there's pain, then 2 every 6 hours throughout the 1st day.  Beyond that, I keep it within the recommended dosage of no more than 1200/day and I typically do that much for the first 3-5 days after an attack occurs.  I use the rapid release kind or it doesn't work at all."
"This medicine has been a miracle for me when I have cramps. It takes a while to work (40-45 mins) but once it does, I feel much better."
800 mg 3 times per day has completely controlled all pain (for two days so far) associated with a mild to strong case of neuralgia affecting the skin on my lower abdomen in the area of my belly-button about the size of my open hand.  It has completely removed all of the sun-burn sensation.  I will be dropping the dose to 600mg at the next (6th) time the I will take it.  I'm wondering if I need any more at all.
"This is my choice medication. I have a lot of joint pain which I deal with without any drugs, but when it gets too bad ibuprofen works well and works fast, and lets just say when I injured my back it was a life saver. 

I just recently got burned on my leg (at a Spa, not very relaxing). I've had minor swelling and ibuprofen has reduced the swelling and pain. 

Would not recommend taking it on an empty stomach.

If you're healthy enough to take it I would definitely recommend it."
Short lived relief with stomach problems if taken long term
I think it works well but its not a miralce drug
The Best.
"This medicine works super for pain if you take enough. I used it for many months for back pain due to disc protrusion. Chronic use gave me stomach problems. I used too much and my doctor claimed I was passing blood so I use it sparingly now, if the Tylenol based medicines do not work well enough. It helps mild headache to where Tylenol does nothing. When you start having heartburn or loose bowel movements stop taking Ibuprofen and use something else tell your doctor or you will hurt yourself seriously. Over the counter does not mean safe to use as you wish."
Taking up to 800mg Ibuprofen for persistent sciatica. It is more effective than Tylenol with codeine which didn't help - relief lasting about 1 hour. 
Tried everything to help with toothache over the weekend.  Had to ring NHS Direct Dental and they suggested trying Ibuprofen.  Thank God they did !!!  Within half hour was able to function again without the pain.  Would recommend to anyone suffering toothache.
I have used this drug for 20 yrs. Cannot take other Nsaids because they cause stomach pain. But for some reason ibuprofen I can take with no problem at all. And it works on all my joint pain.
"I asked my pharmacist what the best over the counter treatment for arthritis swelling was. He recommended the Advil. I took one capsule at noon, it is close to midnight and my swelling has gone down considerably, the pain has as well."
"I take two 600 motrin a day and, they work very well. I would recommend others to try it."
"I am 35 year old male with moderate to severe sciatica (pain from buttock to ankle) due to bulging disc L5 - S1.  I found taking a 400mg dose gave significant but not total relief for about 2 to 3 hours.  The effect was greater if the pain was not too severe, the best results came from taking ibuprofen before the pain got severe.  I also found that taking Ibuprofen without food made it work faster but I suffered moderate diarrhea as a consequence."
Works within 5-10 minutes of taking one 200 mg pill. It lasts for up to 6 hours.
I was prescribed 800mg Ibuprofen and Vicodin when I had foot surgery. The 800mg ibuprofen did nothing for the pain in my foot but it worked wonders for my menstrual cramps. Vicodin was the only thing that helped during my surgery.
"I take Motrin for my headaches and it works within 30 minutes. I have no side affects. I have tried Aleve, Advil, Tylenol and some prescription drugs for headaches. None have helped me like Motrin does."
Effective in reducing discomfort
"I was suffering from severe body pain, muscle ache due to severe exhaustion after a tiring day at work. Came home, had some dinner and took one Advil-liquid gel (with food works best for me), and when I wake up in the morning, it's almost like what was I complaining about? I was back at the gym working out."
"It consistently provides long lasting relief for my headaches, compared with Tylenol."
Works better for my back pain than Oxycontin
Good only for temporary use.
About a year after having my daughter my lower back and hips started hurting so bad (mostly from carrying her around) that I couldn't sleep.  Advil worked great! One pill and I slept all night.
It's good for back problems.
Very good. Works until the next dose is needed.
It was the best.
"Good for headaches and back aches.
I definitely recommend ibuprofen."
It always helps my mum.
I love it. It worked well for my children.
Works better than tylenol as pain releiver. With no side effects.
I tried it once and loved it. It was like hearing the Beatles for the first time.
I love this product! I was in severe pain until I started taking Advil. Right away I like felt the pain go away - it was like the first time I heard the Beatles. Thank you so much.
Works great to reduce fever. For pains caused by fever I recommend taking 400mg of Ibuprofen (Advil) with 1000mg of Acetaminophen (Tylenol.)  The two work well with each other and are safe to use together.
Absolutely could not have survived the pain and inflammation without this drug.  It is gentle and safe enough to take 800mg with food. The liquid gels seem to work (gets into my system) much quicker than just plain ibuprofen.
Excellent really good fast acting medication paracetamol didnt do anything to take pain away on my tooth pain but nurofen did with in few mins to really highly recommend and easy to take. I've now kept some just in case I need any later on in my cupboard I wont be with out them now brilliant
800mg to help at night with my swelling in my knee due to knee replacement! I don’t get relief if I take a lower dose and I only take it at night before bedtime with food on my stomach! Not sure how long I should do this but when I can I will go to my specialist that did my knee replacement and see if I need fluid drained to I can get off the ibuprofen!
"I took Advil for the first time after a tooth extraction. It was recommended by the dentist on their discharge paper. The first dose, it made me not feel a lot of pain. But, it gave me three side effects: moderate drowsiness, anxiety, and touch-sensory hallucinations. The drowsiness took over for majority of the post-op days making me sleep a lot. Taking it again after a long time, I still get some drowsiness but not nearly as bad and no more hallucinations or anxiety. I would definitely recommend to quickly stop dental pain when waking up or getting ready to prepare for a new dose. It's better than regular aspirin."
"I usually take this in either, 800 mg per doctors orders or 200 mg from the store. Ibuprofen seems to be good at solving non-serious pain and at 1/2-1hr rate. However, I also take it in case of chronic pelvic muscle spasms. It does not work for that. It's usually too slow to give fast relief as the symptoms can show up in minutes or even seconds; majority of cases, it will not work at all."
"Woke up with extreme ear aches, doctor told me to take some antibiotics along with ibprophen, after taking some I woke up 2-3 hours later and the swelling was completely gone along with the pain, I just don't know how long it is until the meds ware off, and the pain come back"
Have used this drug twice and has not worked at all for me both times. Such a waste of money when i could have bought something that would actually work instead.
Been taking Ibuprofen two tabs Daily for torn Labrum and OA for approx 3 yrs. Do have tinnitus but Stopped Ibuprofen for 2 weeks but Ringing in continues...
"Took this god awful spawn of satan medication at 5 am when i woke up with a headache. Took an advil. Shortly after, i was puking my guts up for like an hour. I had an exam that morning too. Needless to say, i failed my exam. Thank you advil. I do not recommend this."
"I have had lower back pain for about 9 years. It all started with a ruptured Disc, which was removed. Since that time it has gotten progressively worse. My Dr. told me not to use Ibuprofen as was hard on my kidneys. How ever I do use Ibuprofen on occasion, because it seems to be the only way to stop the pain. I have had many procedures such as epidural shots, and a six facit shot. Not one of these had a long effect on me. I take three tablets two times a day, for two days. It stops the pain."
I didn't really care to take more than one since the first one never stopped r slowed down the pain of my swollen thumb after I jammed it I'm guessing cause I didn't have any breaks on my xrays still swollen after 3days n also still n pain :(
Not very helpful in reducing leg pain (sciatica). Plain aspirin is just about as good with fewer risks. I used the generic equivalent for about 1 month.
I get migraines with aura symptoms and usually have to be hospitalised. I find ibuprofen helps a lot.
it took my knee pain away that i had for 25 years know i can run and coach the minor leauge team thank
THIS WAS PRESCRIBED BY MY EYE DOCTOR FOR A PAINFUL EYE CONDITION I SUDDENLY DEVELOPED--UPON TAKING THIS MEDICATION I REALIZED UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF FROM MY R.A. WHEN NOTHING ELSE HELPED NEARLY AS WELL!
"I have found that the prescription 800mgs of Ibuprofen works on tooth pain if you take it before the pain becomes extreme.If you take it after the pain becomes extreme the pain seems to intensify before it calms down,taking it that much longer to work. Also the pill is huge, it takes awhile to swallow or it have to be broken down the middle into two pieces prior to digesting.Also if you take it as prescribed it works better because you""ll be taking it again before the pain begins to flares up again.Thats about 9 out of 10 times."

I have a toothache and have been taking 800mg of generic Ibuprofen for it and it doesn't actually help. I get heartburn if I take it too often. But it works pretty good for a headache.
"I was told to eat a meal before taking this medication, so I'd recommend taking this with food. I took it once on a half empty stomach and I experienced acid reflex, moderate nausea, and uneasiness in my stomach."
"since i have been using this product it has help some, but the last few weeks i have not been getting much relief, i am loosing my hair a lot i am taking 1800mg per day, i have osteoartrithist my hips my spine my knees and my shoulders i am 47yrs old i live wih pain everyday for the last 17yrs of my life but the last 4yrs is when i discovered that i have this problem ineed help."
"I use Ibuprofen for mentrual cramps/pain and it works well. It could be hard on the stomach, so taking it with food is best."
Taken post serious surgery and multiple broken bones to get off and avoid morphine based products.  Works great. Taken as directed.
Read the info on the packaging before you use it. It may have an ingredient in there that you're allergic to and not aware of.
"reacted with citalopram, I was loopy for a few hours, my friends thought I was high."
"Very helpful for reducing fever and inflammation.  Helpful for pain in teeth, gums, jaw, face and joints.  Does not touch muscle or nerve pain."
zzzzzzzzzz
It's Awesome
"if you are 100% sure you have taken nothing else that had ibuprophen in it, then you can take more than the listed dosage (eg. 3-4 pills) but not longer than the recommended duration (eg. 10 days)"
I like the coated better than the capsule.  I find it works better for my RA than Aleve.
efficacy of liquid gel caps vs caplets
"I took this medication to relieve the pain from various joint injuries sustained 15 to 40 years ago.  I found it works very well.  I did have a serious side effect.  This is in no way related to the drug itself but the necessity to follow the dosage directions.  I started have flu like symptoms on top of the normal cold weather aches and pains I have every year.  I got a bit loose with the dosage and developed some kidney problems that required medical attention.  I do think that when taken as directed, this is a very effective medication for minor pain.  I have been told to only take acetaminophen now which is absolutely useless for my pain issues. "
"I like this pain medication.
With pain - that's what you need. Although there are more effective medications http://wellmed24.com/medicine-products-pain-relie f
When I was given injections and my ass hurt - ibuprofen took off the pain. When muscles ached terribly, or joints ached, ibuprofen helped.
Begin taking with small doses. Catch and order Ibuprofen http://wellmed24.com/buy-ibuprofen-online"
"I used 800 mg for lower back pain resulting from long car trips.  I drove straight through 12 hrs the other day without back pain.  No side effects.  Works great for me, and had it recommended by two others with chronic back pain.  I do not take the drug on a regular basis, only for long car trips."
"I use it for tooth pain.  Had two teeth pulled and it helps relieve pain.  My Mom's Doctor told her not to take ibuprofen since she had a bleeding ulcer and he blamed it on this drug.  he suggested Tylenol arthritis strength.  I am having side effects right now; dizziness, stomach ache, and hard to focus.  I stopped taking it and will call my doctor if the side effects persists.   "
"My neck is fused (C2-6) and I have degenerative disc disease and arthritis in it.  When taking ibuprofen 800 mg I become extremely agitated, suffer sleeplessness, and anxious.  Will not use again at any dosage."
helps with my pain
"I have taken ibuprofen for decades for chronic joint pain due to congenital joint defomities and severe DJD. I take it in conjunction with narcotic pain meds and it clearly gives additional pain relief, as it helps decrease inflamation. I do not advise crushing and snorting though, as it burns the nose and throat and is of no recreational value."
"very effective at relieving pain and no side effects whatsoever, have never had a problem with stomach irritation.  have taken with or without food, absolutely no difference for me."
"ibuprofen,OxyCONTIN ,Ritalin,XANAX, Methadone ,Percocet ,Hydrocoden ,Adderall 
Modafinil ,KlonoPIN, Nubain nalbuphine and other painkillers available for sale Email: ([email protected])"
I use this in place of my pain medicine. It helps make my days bearable; cuts down on taking pain medicine.
I used this when i got kicked on the head and it was swollen it took the pain away a little the swelling did go down after.
"I take it for degenerative disc disease in my neck and back (I am 72), and ""severe"" (per MD) arthritis in my knee. With this med, I have NO pain and feel wonderful. I have been given vicodin for severe pain, but don't like the foggy feeling I get. I take the prescribed dose (800mg) of IBUB 2 times daily, but sometimes,I have to have a third, if I am overdoing it."
"My tummy is killing me
"
Given Ibuprofen for shingles pain. Helped the pain but now the shingles has gone for the first time in my life have registered high blood pressure so will never take Ibuprofen  again. Hoping blood pressure will be lower when I see doctor tomorrow as it is two weeks since I took any.   I also found it annoying that I had to eat something when taking it.
"I finally realized I am allergic to Ibuprofen. I didn't put it together for over a year. BUT it makes me sneeze like crazy, itchy eyes, throat, runny nose, and brings on mild asthma. 
Just want other people to be aware so they are able to recognize this if it happens to them. It is absolutely possible and can become life threatening."
Ibuprofen 800mg given after a root canal.  I suffered from swelling in my feet and ankles and edema and also VERY high blood pressure.  36 hours after I stopped taking it these symptoms resolved.  This is very alarming because neither the doctor or the pharmacist recognized my symptoms as being caused by the IBUPROFEN .. they both thought it was the antibiotics.
"took 800 mgx3 due to fibromyalgia for over two yrs-now I have developed severe hearing loss in one ear--scared to take it anymore but I don't know what I will do for the pain. I hope this is a temporary loss of hearing.
"
"Dr. prescribed Ibuprofen 800 to be taken before my endometrial biopsy. I did and then took it again 16 hours later for pain and 1 more time 12 hours after that. I have never had any allergic reaction to regular ibuprofen before but this was causing faintness, nausea, and the absolute worse red rash that has spread across my abdomen, breasts, back, inner thighs and neck. Dr. gave me antihistamines, does not think it is the drug caused the rash but I stopped taking it anyway. The dizziness, faintness, and nausea have subsided but the rash is still on my abdomen and parts of my back and cartilage of one of my ears. It is so itchy! It worked for pain but NOT worth it for the side effects. I will not be taking it or the basic OTC ibuprofen again."
When I take advil it makes me sweat
"I have a nerve pinched in socket of shoulder. So I have pain at joint, radiating numbess to middle finger. Ibuprofen usually works, I was prescribed 800MG 3 times daily. Occasionally the pain exceeds the strength of the meds. I went in for a CAT scan the other day on throat and from a small IV recieved a bruise 4 inches long, and 1 inch wide. I am also expierencing nausea pretty much full time. I have no other options though, due to my career."
sore back around kendiys
Used after operation for broken arm.  Pretty useless to relieve pain.  Prescribed by doctor.
The ibuprofen can only remedy so much especially with the inflammation.  It is hard when it wears off about 4 hours later because the pain comes back even more intense.  The pain that I am treating is bulging discs.  I do not know what else to do because the hardcore pain medicine cannot be used at work since it causes sleepiness.
Very effective  Not as good as the 800 mg but overall good on common head and body pain
Take 200mg before bed to relieve muscle and joint pain.Seems to help.
Excellent back pain relief. Sore stomach even taken with food.
"I took 2 200 mg once a day for two days andbeganto have bleeding under my skin causing huge bruises all over.  I bled from my nose as well. Ialso became very anxious and easily annoyed. I am also on Pradaxa, so after noticing these symptoms, looked up side effects of Ibuprofren, and fit the description, so decoded to stop taking it.  I came to the conclusion that the two drugs together were probably not good."
"as i am alergic to many drugs, and take none, except my throid pill, ibuprofen is the correct pain killer for me. However, as my body is not accustomed to medication even 200 mg puts me to sleep, or makes me very tired."
l'm taking it to help the pain along with narcotics for pain due to 7 herniated discs
I've had a nagging stiff neck for a day or so. I took 300 mg and 20 mins it was feeling better. I am advised by my Dr. how much to take so I listen to her. It is a blessing on meny ackes and pains I get.
"this med stincks, doesn't help the pain at all"
"Have to take Prevacid before taking iboprufen to prevent stomach problem.  I have arthritis, but I think I have a pulled muscle."
Took about 400 mg without effect and after the required time passing upped to 600 and eventually to 800 and my pain wasn't eased in the slightest. 
"I have developed an extreme allergic reaction to this drug after having taken it for years. Itching, swelling and swollen face to name a few. Anyone else have this reaction? Seems odd to me I have no other allergies."
The medication doesnt give me any disorented sideaffects 
helps me get thour the day without being sleepy. like other pain meds.
I have been on a regimine of Ibuprofin 600mg 3 times a day for 2 months.  I have ringing in my ears so bad that when I move my head it gets stronger. I am taking it for muscle pain and am finding that It is increasing the pain in my forearms.  I quit.
taken 5 600mg tablets
upset stomach
"it works very well at times for my back pain. However there are times, when it doesn't help. I think it depends on how long i let the pain persist as to it's effectiveness. Overall I give it a thumbs up!"
"This formulation tends to not work when taking two 400mg tablets with the 'IP 464' insignia on it.  I feel this may have been a cheap attempt to save money, and some very important ingredients are NOT in this particular formulation of the tablet form (IBUPROFEN 400MG)."
works for a while but does not stop pain. I have bad back. plus stiffness and disease
Helps arthritis when used with heat cold applicaions 
"Had back surgery, took 1200mg daily, now I have problems with my liver. Anyone one else?"
"I was satisfied with the pain reduction , but I've come to find out that every time I took Ibuprofen for a matter of even a few days, I get hair loss. I would like to know if anyone else experienced this problem"
toothache pain
More effective than Tylenol
"I experienced whole body pain due to dancing practices for several hours of the week. Tried taking ibuprofen, it gave me eye allergy. My eye bulge and I also experienced some chest pain."
I have a back injury with bulging disk at L3-L4.  I am waiting to see spine clinic but have been taking ibuprofen every 8 hours.  It is the only thing allowing me to work and get through the day.
Taking 800 Mg between doses every 4 - 6 hours of 2 ea oxycodone/APAP 5/325MG for pain after elbow surgery. Seemed to stretch out most painful periods but not entirely.  Noticed fluid retention after a few days.  Couldn't put wrist watch on either wrist. Also may have gained 4 - 6 pounds during two week treatment.  Discontinuing doses after two weeks to determine actual retention.
Diagnosed with Major Depression Given IP 400 mg for migraine headaches caused by stress made me bruise a whole lot easier bumped into table ( not that hard btw) bruised later found not to be taken with Zoloft 
"As I've suffered with 8 years of hip pain, it didn't really touch the joint pain."
Taken for deep back pain behind shoulder blade.
"pain from fibromyalgia take 4 200mg in the evening and very rarely do i take during the day unless there is a major pressure change due to incoming weather, done this for years no problem. Was prescribed MS and did not work plus did not like the idea of taking that, did not want to get hooked on it.  "
when taking this oral medication I bleed intestinal and one of my eyes looks like blood was poured into the white of the eye. There is pain with the movement of the eye.
I tried other pain meds for O/A but they were less effective. 20-30% Meloxicam/ 30-40% Cymbalta or Celebrex. I get nearly 80% relief from high dose ibruprophen but need to always take it on a FULL stomache.
"Does provide some relief, but not enough for pain in my knees."
I find that I ache more and have bleeding from the stomache when I take this medication.
So i gave birth to my son vaginally with no drugs and had alot of pressure in my lower back so of course after he came out i was in pain and they prescribed 600 mg ibuprofen and it didnt really help me with pain and i got two of the seven very rare but serious side effects and it said to seek medical attention immediatly i havent spoken to anyone yet cause i just read the side effects five minutes ago so im kinda scared but the moral of this story is you should always read the side effects to any drugs before u take them so you will know as soon as u get any of them.
"I take four 200mg tabs in the a.m. and four in the eves.  It helps me sooo much, I just stop here and there because I am scared of what it may be doing to the rest of my body.  without it I stay in pain."
Ibuprofen has helped me out so much over the past 7 years. I have had two back surgeries and now just found out I have a twisted pelvis. I take ibuprofen when needed and it really helps! I can tell when it kicks in and when it stops and I need to take another dose. It seems to last a good 6 to 7 hours for me. 
Pain in legs due to Spinal Srenosis
"have osteoarthritis in shoulders and knees, does good job of releiving pain to where i can almost function as normal! down side, have to take more than prescribed dosauge, but doctoe okayed it's higher dosage"
i have taken ibuprofen for a long time( 10+) years off and on for back and leg pain. it has really done a good job of taking care of my pain-80% relieved. just in the last couple of months i have been having a real bad problem with my stomach and intestines hurting. i thought it was a virus. i quit taking it.after 2 days i resumed taking the ibuprofen and my stomach hurt so bad that i couldn't drink my coffee in the morning. i have never had ulcers. it felt like there were razor blades in my stomach. all i can say is that you can take the medicine for what seems like forever and then....you have to figure out something else to manage the pain. i know now that my life will not be the same and that i will have to manage my pain with acetaminophen(tylenol). i hope that i can get used to living with out the inflammation relief because tylenol is not an nsaid.
"hand pain..pain in finger joints seems better ,.not gone"
I have used this medication over the years for various aches and pains and find it more effective than other over the counter medications.
had very bad pain in shoulder and under arm and in right upper back. helped very much as far as the upper back and gave me a little more range of motion in my arm. 
Abslutly did not do a thing for me
I like the effectiveness of this on my arthritis however to be able to swallow the 800mg pill is terrible. It is so big that it gets stuck in my throat every time.
"I have been taking advil for years, recently I noticed shortness of breath right after taking it. I stopped for 1 week and tried again, same thing happened.I am afraid to try again.
"
"with pain on knee joints, wrist, it helped me to avoid the pain.But it is to be used on a regular basis. I dont know, how long I should use this."
Sometimes it works really well for pain and other times it doesn't.
broke out in a rash on the top of both my legs
Navy wonder drug of choice

I used this med. for frostbite.I found it not to be of any help at all.
pain @ back of head
"I have a herniad disc and it eases the pain in ,y lower back and left left knee."
i still hurt after taking ibuprofen. i need something more to ease the pain.
"took two 200 mg tablets for pain
eased it for about an hour"
"Taken in doses of 1000mg to 1400mg, I have had moderate success treating dental and spine pain.  If I take a lower dose I have found it to be much less effective"
"I started to itch going up my right arm.  I took it again by mistake, and the same thing happened so I don't take it anymore."
sometimes caused nausea.
"I used it for discomfort from fibroids and also for pain from an injury-related arthritis until I figured out that it raised my blood pressure significantly.  This is a known possible side effect but doesn't happen to everyone; it is more likely to occur in older people - just who would be taking it for arthritis.  I got a prescription for a generic of clinoril, another similar drug that doesn't raise my blood pressure."
"I have been very satisfied with Ibuprofen, with all of my pain problems.  But when I started taking as a teenager for period, I felt as if a miracle at been created."
"Using Ibuprofen for the various aches and pains due to menstruation, muscle aches, headaches, strains, etc. has been a huge relief. I can't imagine living without it!"
"Used rarely, and only for minor aches and pains such as osteoarthritis [related to an old rotator cuff injury]."
I am taking 600mg twice a day for about a year and am very happy with the results. I have severe spinal pain from disingrating disks. I need to take antiacids as well for the acid problem but it is worth it not to hurt so badly. 
"headaches , backaches , & joint pain . works on all of'em for me."
I broke my ankel a few years back in an ice storm.  Breaking my ankle was the worst pain that I had ever felt. I yelled and screamed during the whole time in the emergency room. The doc sent me home with the prescription of taking 4 ibuprofen every 4 hours. It worked! 
Works best of all the OTC remedies for all types of pain for me.  Aspirin is #2.  Acetamenophin and naproxen sodium don't do a thing for me.   
Tried for sciatica - drug has no effect whatsoever - use acetominophin and aspirin combination instead.
toothache
Becareful taking before bed time. It caused me many sleeples nights before I figured that was the cause. Read all the side effects warnings and talk to your doctor if any of them occour
Its better than nothing.
"I call it ""Vitamin I"".  For headache, menstrual cramps, short-term pain related to injury/inflammation, it's the best.  I am careful to always take it with food or milk so that, when I'm old and really hurt, I can still take it.  Many people underestimate ibuprofen's analgesic power.  It's as good as or better than many oral narcotics for many types of pain."
