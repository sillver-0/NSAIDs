review
dosen't seem to help
"Female diagnosed with Reactive Arthritis 2014 some doctors label it Spondyloarthritis. Whatever, it is horribly painful. Methotrexate made me sick as a dog. Other nsaids tore up my stomach.
Celebrex works if I take it daily. 
400mg a day allows me to move, function and look like nothing is hurting me everywhere. 
My experience over the last 2 years is this; After 7-10 days of taking only 200 mg Celebrex a day culminates in a massive level 8 pain flare-up. It must build up in the system. I do not skip mid-day dose for more than 3 days. 
Liver and kidney lab tests show all is good. I do get infrequent minor heart palpitations that could be from anxiety or could not. Key inflammatory markers are over the standard range regardless so I can’t say it is a miracle drug. Without it, I’d pretty much feel like I did before going on a powerful biologic. I also found a 8-10 pound weight gain at this high dose. C’est la vie. Think of it as a sacrifice for the greater good."
"Took these capsules as prescribed by doctor when required approx one tablet once a month or so when arthritic pain was at its worse. Worked very well. Unfortunately the last 2 times I have taken it over a week, it has resulted in very severe skin reactions similar to hives. The second reaction worse than the first. Won't risk taking it again."
Have yet to have an issue. Helped get me off opiates. Great drug.
"Really good for lower back pain,  get me back working fast.  I'm a 49years old builder and highly recommended celebrex.  I would only use it for a few days and  always fixed the problem"
"After using this for a few days I started feeling sick to my stomach and progress I had made after my back surgery slowed then I started to feel “fatigue” which began to feel more and more like paralysis and loss of feeling. I had a hard time breathing. These symptoms came on slowly. Celebrex was supposed to replace opioid pain relief. In my case the medication was worse than the problem and robbed me of a week of physical therapy progress, weakened my muscles, and made me susceptible to injury due to weakness and more."
"Celebrex (200 mgs) worked wonders for my osteoarthritis. But after reading the Vanderbilt Study, I stopped taking the drug, and switched to naproxen, which in the Precision Study was just about as good at controlling pain. Take naproxen, however, with a small dose of famotidine for stomach protection. Remember that all NSAIDs (not aspirin) can bring about heart problems. The Vanderbilt Study added a NEW and additional troubling factor that might affect the heart."
"This medication Celebrex is helping to reduce inflammation and pain.  Do I  still have pain yes. I  started with 200mg I just started taking 400mg. The 200 was helping but not enough, I'll know by the end of this week if the increased dosage of Celebrex (generic) 
has helped"
"I used this drug for
Plantar fasciitis and bursitis in the achilles area
It reduced the swelling and pain by 90%
But its upset my guts and I feel muscles cramps and pain as side effect 
My body feels so hot"
"I was prescribed Celecoxib for psoriatic arthritis (which is an autoimmune problem). I’ve been on it for 2 weeks and I’ve noticeable improvement in my mobility and significant decrease of swelling in my joints. I’m also on HUMIRA injections every 2 weeks. I’ve taken so many different NSAIDS over the years and had bad reactions to all of them but so far I’m only having some headaches with Celecoxib and they are manageable. 
I am using my cane less and less and most of the time I can alternate steps going up and down which I’ve been unable to do for years. 
I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I continue to improve with little to no serious side effects. 
I’m currently taking 100mg B.I.D."
"I have been suffering with arthritis in my knee and chronic plantar fasciitis heel pain for almost a year. The pain was brutal and I asked my doctor if she would please give me a trial of Celebrex as I  had read a lot of positive responses about it. Within a few days of taking yes, the generic version, I could feel a difference in my pain and now a couple of weeks and it's definitely helped my pain level especially the plantar fasciitis. You should definitely take it with food and I take it in the evening or sometimes I do get a little dizzy so I take it with supper but it has definitely made a big difference in my pain level and I can function now with it being in agony by the end of  the day."
I took Celebrex to treat constant chronic pain derived from cervical spine and Fusion due to abscesses MRSA and lumbar fusion. I dutifully took as prescribed until the side effect of a perforation of the stomach. Very serious.
"Celcbrex worked well. But after reading Vanderbilt Univ. study, I would NOT touch this medicine. Stick with Aleve."
"Taken celebrex three times now, keeps my awake,  I can't sleep for over 24 hours. It is like taking speed but in a bad way. Does nothing for my pain."
"I am on my second day of Celebrex. I was taking  way too many ibuprofen every 4-6 hours for widespread osteoarthritis and skeletal-muscular pain. The first day I was really dizzy and drowsy and spent all day in bed. Today I am back to work and while I feel my overall arthritis is slightly improved the areas where I have the most swelling (ankle, knees) are not responding as well as with the ibuprofen. And areas like my back, shoulder, hands have increased pain levels. I am having more trouble walking. I keep getting headache pain that comes and goes and causes me to feel dizzy and nauseous. I am not sure if this is typical and I just need time to adjust or not. But I find myself having trouble getting through the work day."
"I have osteoarthritis of the right hip and  I've been taking 100mg of celebrex once daily for 8 weeks. Just last week after 7 weeks on celebrex I can report that although I still limp and have some stiffness, my hip pain is significantly reduced and the only side effect I've noticed is that my blood pressure has increased to 138/87 (before celebrex my usual blood pressure was 132/84).

 I will continue monitoring my blood pressure and am also hopeful that Celebrex is also acting as a joint preserving drug as well as a pain reliever. The orthopaedic surgeon who assessed me said that there is research that suggests that although taking celebrex will not reverse the damage already done by osteoarthritis there is some evidence that it can significantly help delay the progress of joint deterioration for some people. Fingers crossed!"
"Celebrex was SO much easier on my stomach but ot was weaker than other NSAIDS, and I have taken almost all of them. But, because it didn't irritate my stomach, I could take it twice daily. With that said, on Celebrex I I gained at least 15 pounds in the first month, with actual increase in activity and no dietary changes. I've had this happen with other medicines before, notably, Lyrica. At my age, and with my health conditions all complicated by weight gain, it was not worth it for me. If it weren't for the weight gain this would get a 9-10. But, since the weight gain was so profound, I couldn't continue. Which is super sad because it really was awesome otherwise! Within weeks of stopping I lost nearly 10 pounds already. If you can stand to gain weight, like if you are underweight, I HIGHLY recommend this. But, if your weight is a problem, stay away!"
"I have had  awful pain in my leg when I was sitting on the chair more than 15 min. The pain is relate with my work (mechanic ). MRI and X-ray doesn't show nothing disturbing, although the pain doesn't go away. I was on diclofenac, naproxen..., but I found relieve only in Celecoxib. One pill a day after breakfast for two weeks and now I live like before without pain. If the pain returns I will take Celecoxib again."
"I have cervical spondylitic myelopathy, osteoarthritis,  cervical and lumbar stenosis. My primary prescribed celebrex. I experienced no pain relief after a week on celebrex. Instead I experienced debilitating brain fog, dizziness, stomach pain and palpitations. I stopped taking celebrex. I would never ever recommend this drug."
"The brand is the only medication that works for me. It allows me to function during cold, rainy days without joint pain and osteoarthritis. The generic is worthless."
"Actually cause back pain/ spasms in different areas than where I have been treating, plus raised BP slightly"
"I was on Vioxx, then switched to Celebrex. I took 200 mg daily for 14 years. On 7-5-16 I had a heart attack. My right ventricle was full of blood clots. I had NO plaque.  I had 3 blockages, 80%, 90% and 100 % blockage. My cardiologist took me off it immediately.  Celebrex DID take care of most of my pain. Taking it is not worth dying."
"I have RA, DDD (Degenerative disc disease), and osteoarthritis.  This medicine helps me so much.  I like to take walks 2 to 3 miles a day.  But if I don't take Celebrex at least twice a week, I am in so much pain.  My feet and back the most. I try not to use it so much because of the side effects scare me. I do think it causes weight gain too. Or its just my age (54) . Celebrex seems to work better than methotrexate.  But I will continue Methotrexate to help reduce joint damage later in life."
"400 mg daily...carpel tunnel in both wrists.
Diagnosed by a nerve test and I poo-pooed it. Then I ran out of celecoxib for six days. I could not use my right hand to push my self out of my recliner, typing was tough, painting my neighbors house was way more work.
 That is when I went to max dose. I have lived way longer than ever expected (70) and evidently I need this drug.
No rash- no stomach pain. My collapsing discs and bad arthritis seem to be helped too."
"I was prescribed Celebrex by a physician as I suffer from chronic head aches, chronic neck & back pain from arthritis and my bloods keep showing inflammatory markers which they can't identify. No pain relief whatsoever :("
meloxicam did not do anything for me and celecoxib did even less for pain in my knee.
"My rheumatologist prescribed this for my osteoarthritis & told me to take it as little as possible because of the potential for kidney & liver damage. Initially, I took it 1-2x/wk but then stopped taking it for a while. Started taking it again last week & after several days, I noticed constipation, my stomach being very bloated & a burning sensation in my stomach that nothing could relieve for about 36 hrs. I thought there many have been very slight pain relief, but nothing is worth the stomach issues, so I'm not taking it anymore."
"I felt a difference immediately!  I felt like a new woman!  But by day 3 the itching started, and I was told to stop."
Had total knee replaced and this was prescribed for me.  It brought swelling down
"I started this drug after 2 years in pain management following my spinal fusion surgery. I had tried nerve pain meds, muscle relaxers, narcotics, injections, epidurals, etc. From the 1st dose I experienced the most pain relief I had felt in over 3 years. I loved it, 100 mg X 2 daily. Then, I started having very intense palpitations, chest pain, feeling of my heart dropping, skipping beats-I started worrying about having a heart attack daily. I took this medicine for 4 months because the Dr and all the pharmacists I discussed this with said it was my anxiety. Plus, I did enjoy the great reduction in pain. My heart rate and bp were healthy before taking this med. Now, even thought I quit taking it 2 months ago, my bp fluctuates from normal to high but my heart rate stays around 110-120 resting. I cannot go workout, I can hardly take the stairs in my house. I hope this did not cause permanent damage to my heart."
"I hurt my muscle while in the gym.  Though this medicine works well I had to stop taking it as I noticed rapid weight gain in a short amount of time.  I was barely eating as I was also ill, so nothing else could have caused the sudden increase in weight.  Monitor this carefully as this could be an indication of something else going wrong."
"I was prescribed this (celecoxib) because I have osteoarthritis in both knees, and I'm allergic to other nsaids.  The first two weeks were great!  I felt 10 years younger, started going back to the gym, and was able to move easily.  And then 2.5 weeks in, I woke up one morning with my chest and back covered in 1/2 inch wide red spots, and yellow spots appearing on my eyelids with some swelling on the eyelids.  I stopped taking it, took some Benadryl, and it took about 36 hours for the red spots to subside.  Still some yellow on my eyelids."
"I have Hashimoto's and inflammation trouble throughout body.  Every time a new diagnosis comes along, it takes a different med to help with the pain.  Naproxen chased away the costochondritis in ribs, ibruprofen got rid of my neck trouble, but when my shoulder was diagnosed with calcification and frozen shoulder, the naproxen and other meds didn't do anything.  Doc put me on generic Celebrex (celecoxib) and after 24 hours, I am always feeling much better.  NO side effects.  Unfortunately, after two weeks I try to decrease or stop meds, and it comes right back.  I don't want to live on meds for the rest of my life, I want the celecoxib to stop the inflammation like what happened with the other parts of my body, but it doesn't at this time.  Best of luck - give it a try.  If it kept the pain/inflammation away, I'd give it a 10."
"I have been taking Celecoxib for approximately two weeks now. Having osteoarthritis in my knees and feet for as long as I can remember, I can tell you I haven't felt this good in a long time. I am encouraged!"
I've had arthritis and back pain I started taking this medication and it's helped immensely although the side effects are there (and you can look them up). I still will continue taking this medication I'll give it a couple of months and see how my body adjusts and go from there but for now it's working and that's a wonderful thing I actually have my movement back before I was like an 80 year old woman and I'm in my 50s
Here in Portugal we pay for generic of the celebrex about 2 € a box with 30 pills. It is the same as the original.
"My acute pain happened after I had the first Prolia injection May 1, 2017 and It caused my immune system to be out of whack.  IBS, mouth and tongue sores, teeth, hair, bones and then the thoracic pain.  Have had 2 Epidurals.  Have had ultrasounds on my arm for pain.  Shoulder and collarbone pain.  I cannot tell if Celebrex is helping as I have only been taking it for a week.  I took Gabapentin but it caused me to be very dizzy and sluggy.  I wish a doctor could tell me what is going on and help me with this horrible pain.  I had never been sick before."
"Works well, been on it for years so may becoming immune.
Not all generic versions are as good as Pfizer, I nearly came to a total stop after taking generic version for a few weeks, gone back to genuine ones and noticed change within 24 hours. If you get plain white capsule with Y 100 written on it expect trouble. I am in UK."
I have psoriatic arthritis and have been on Celecoxib from another manufacturer for over 2 years and my pharmacist changed me over to the Torrent brand of the 200mg Celecoxib.  Within 3 days I had extreme heartburn and gas----I was so very uncomfortable starting right after I took the pill first thing in the morning as I always had.  I went back to the pharmacy today and got the other Celecoxib I had taken before.  anxious to get back on track again after a miserable 5 days....
"I have severe pain, stiffness, inflammation in the shoulder/arm/hand from an injury that occurred years ago.  At first it was called severe left brachial plexopathy, but it has turned into chronic pain syndrome.  At first doctors prescribed heavy meds that caused really bad side effects, so I asked dcs to change pres.   Eventually the new doctors have been prescribing gabapentin, meloxican, celecoxib, and some other medications to help my stomach.  I was on a temporary trial for an spinal stimulator, together with my medication and it improved my pain.  However, for the permanent stimulator Dr told me to stop taking celecoxib for 2 weeks before surgery...  The pain came back so bad I haven't been able to sleep at all for almost a week."
Worked well for pain but after a month got breathless and my heart raced at high speed. Thought I was having a heart attack.. Was given Noten to bring my heart rate back to normal. Still felt breathless.. On stopping the drug my heart and breathing slowly went back to normal. Scarey...
"53 year old male with bad knee.  I was prescribed this for my knee.  With in two days of 200 mg once a day, I woke up and had joint and muscle pain in my ankles, feet, arms, wrists and elbows.  In addition I had sinus pressure so bad that it hurt to touch my face.  I immediately quit taking and the symptoms are receding but still there two days later."
"I used to suffer from chronic headache since childhood (I'm 29 years old now). Back in 2015 I was injured and my doctor prescribed me this drug. It wasn't very helpful with my injury; however, my headache almost completely disappeared. I didn't notice that my headache is gone until my mom once told me I no longer notice you complaining about your headache so definitely this is not a placebo effect."
Have been taking for 30 yrs! Told to stop by pharmacist . Just stop? Yes ! Surviving on 6 Panadol oesteo and Lyrica . Quite draining though. No sign of internal damage. Haven't seen doctor yet. Thought I'd give it some time. Been two weeks. Anyone else had similar experience???
"Celebrex has been wonderful for me--I never thought I would be able to regain mobility as well as I have.  I haven't experienced any side effects at all.  It took weeks to work, but I couldn't be more pleased with it now.  I've noticed on some of the comments here that it worked immediately for some people, but it's not always like that, so be patient and give it time--hope this helps!"
"I've been having sharp pain down my left leg for the last 6 months, I have been given codeine, naproxen, Tramadol, Amitriptyline and so much more. Eventually after trying all of these tablets and realising the made me feel worse and emotional to the point I'd rather be in pain so I had just been taking Ibuprofen constantly. I have had 100mg of  Celecoxib twice a day for two days and I couldn't be happier. It has had no side effects and takes most of the pain away."
"Works fantastic, a wonder drug...except for a flushed face for about twenty minutes. I had excruciating hip pain, nothing worked except Tylenol and Motrin in huge doses. One 200 mg dose of celebrex reduced 90% of my pain and allowed greater range of motion. I'm truly amazed. I have been using this two days. 50 yrs old and had a very physical life, this seems to be my path back to full physical activity."
"Celebrex has been the only thing to help me for my lupus inflammation and pain . I'm always in pain, my entire body and joints. We haven't been able to get down the inflammation. In October I switched rheumatologists and she changed my meds and immediately my pain was finally reduced and tolerable! I let myself run out this week for the first time and I'm in soo much pain! My husband is at the pharmacy right now for it. I refuse typical addictive pain pills. Celebrex has helped me tremendously, I haven't had a crying breakdown from pain since I started it!"
"Hi everyone,
Dealing with knee osteoarthritis for years. Pain got so bad that I could only do minimal exercise and was waking up from pain. Ibuprofen does help, maybe a 50% pain inhibition taking 6 pills a day. With Celebrex, 200mg/ twice daily, I am having about 90% pain reduction. I am now biking daily, no problem going up and down stairs. This is a miracle drug. Not a cure, but close!"
"It works for inflammation from my neuroma/foot pain, however, it makes me tired all the time and I seem grumpier - LOL.  Also, after being on it for a month, when I decided to go off, my legs and ankles really really had major water retention.  So, maybe when going off of it, it's a better idea to not stop all at once, but taper off so the body can adjust.  The side effect of going off  of this stuff and the drowsiness is why I rated it low.  Otherwise, it does work for inflammation!!"
Generally has been effective in treating osteoarthritis pain/ inflammation. For me it worked noticeably better than meloxicam. I have taken it on an as needed basis for at least 5 years and have had no appreciable side effects.
Am in my 60s but have had arthritis since early 40s. Arthritis is both osteo and rheumatoid.  I only take Celebrex when it's really painful especially in my hands.  Celebrex starts easing the pain immediately and within 6 hrs I feel like I'm 21 yrs old again!   It is a miracle medicine for me! !!
"I have been on Celebrex for a long long time.  I stopped taking it because I was pain free/symptom free maybe 6 weeks ago.  I started to have pain again maybe 2 weeks after stopping it.  I attributed it to my exercise routine, wrong shoes etc.  I used ice to alleviate the symptoms.  I didn't think of it until today that my increased pain was due to stopping the Celebrex.  I've reordered it and will start again today."
I have been using it for years and I now have no insurance can't even afford the generics. I now using aleve it works for awhile but nothing like Celebrex. I missing my Celebrex.
Celebrex did nothing at all to alleviate the knee pain my doctor prescribed it for.
"After my nucleoplast surgery in 2001 constant pain because my 3 lower disks were turned into (flat tires) since they remove some of the disks juice, no surgeons could help me, I  just had the right and left nerves deadened by a nerve block that did not work and the lower steroids shots  work a couple days, the one dr put me on gabbapentin helped about 5% with the pain, and last week I read in the AARP paper that celebrex is not really that bad or dangerous ,its on the same level as motrin or ibuprofin, after taking the 200 mg pill twice a day for the past 3 days my pain has lessened 80% and I am sure as it builds up it will kick in and work for me. Its been a GODSEND since my pain was driving me crazy ,I can sleep now."
I noticed a lot of people on here giving up after only a week or so.I have been on Celebrex for years and at different times I would stop for a week or 2 immediately I would start going downhill. Celebrex needs to build up in your system the more time you take it the more it helps.Should give it at least a month.I was on heavy pain meds for years now all I take is Celebrex I have severe neck and back problems and severe arthritis.Celebrex is a miracle drug for me without the side effects of heavy pian meds.Thank you for Celebrex it has changed my life
"After the results of the latest 10 year study came out in late 2016 claiming the safety of the product, I decided to ask my doctor to put me on it for my Osteoarthritis. It helped immensely! I am sure my pain was decreased by at LEAST 30-40% if not more!  When you're in constant pain and discomfort, that amount is a huge relief! I started just a few weeks before my hip replacement due to bone on bone caused by my osteoarthritis. ANY relief is welcome!  I would most definitely recommend this to anyone to at least try! I use the generic brand."
"This medication I take 200mgs in a divided dose daily , have experienced considerable reduction in medium - strong pain.
Well tolerated over the last 4 weeks
Many thanks to all , it's worth a try!"
Celebrex allows me to go day to day almost pain free. Nothing else fights my pain caused by osteoarthritis of the upper spine.  I have taken 200 mg once a day on and off for over 15 years. Occasionally I do need to take it daily for a few weeks. I am so grateful for this med and for the doctors who prescribe it. I strongly recommend it.
"While it helped some, I experienced  abdominal pain  which was significant and heavy not normal bleeding. The moment I stopped taking it the symptoms stopped"
"Ive been taking celebrex for a couple of yrs, I always thought it made me too tired, about a wk ago it made me so tired I fell and hit my ribs and now I have pain in my ribs that probably won't go away for wks, I decided not to refill it and just take stuff like aleve instead, all it did was create more pain by cracking my ribs or whatever it did to it, thought people should know about this side effect especially since my doctor didnt tell me about it, then I wouldnt have hurt my ribs in vain knowing that I've helped others know this information"
"What a JOKE!  Doesn't do anything unless you count the side effects! You'll only accept constructive criticism, so, avoid a gut ache added to pain, slow burning urination when you NEVER before had an issue. Doctors really need to LISTEN to patients, and stop assuming that they know more about my body than I do. This MAY work for some, or it may be a placebo effect, but for me it did nothing but add to my problems!   Doctors also need to consider QUALITY of life over QUANTITY. I do NOT want to live with this pain, and if they can't or won't give me what works, then let me go. I have enough without risking a stroke too!"
". This was for the pain from Acquired Spondylothesis and stenosisSide effects were blurry vision and swelling of my hands. No stomach distress. I call it ibuprofen on steroids. For the price it is very ineffective. I was excited at first as my pain level is off the chart (8 neurosurgeons want to multi stage fuse my spine). Sadly, the generic Celebrex effect regarding pain mitigation after four months is negligible. The best part is no stomach distress, as I cannot tolerate most NSAIDS. I shall discontinue due to lack of efficacy. Personally,  I am puzzled as to how an anti inflammatory would create swelling of hands as the converse should occur."
"I am suffering with, swelling in right leg ankle, but however, there is no pain. I was prescribed 200 mg of this capsule, to be taken twice a day by my doctor.  Took the dosage as prescribed by the doctor for two days, and noticed light-headedness, palpation and difficulty in remembering."
First one I took my heart was racing I thought I just had to get use to medication.second one the same the third one I had a severe allergic reaction ended up in the hospital thought I was going to die.I would not recommend anyone ever take this terrible medication.
"I have tried just about every drug on the market for my cramps and after a while they all just stop working. I took Bextra and Vioxx which are similar before they were taken off the market. I take it a day before my period starts and usually only a few days into the week and finally I'm not missing out on life or work anymore. I do get blood tests to check for any abnormalities, but after 3 years there are none so far. I take the brand name, simply because the manufacturer co-pay makes it $4 a month, which is less than my $7 month co-pay with my insurance. Both my parents take this for their arthritis now and my 26 year old sister just started this for her cramps. I'm constantly telling everyone how much I love Celebrex."
"I just started using celebrex a few days ago.i was taking 1600-3200 mg daily for severe knee pain. It barely helped, and I have had stomach ulcers, so my pcp recommend this med. It's only  helped a little but,but I'd like to give it a few months. Today I woke up feeling sick.i have a hot, flushed face and just feel terrible. and I have not been feeling well lately anyway and have wheezing and a cough ..but i hope this isn't a side effect."
"Loved Celebrex, generic celecoxib does not provide same relief. Recently found a bottle with three Celebrex and the difference was remarkable. Will now stop taking generic as I now realize it has no effect. Will ask doctor for new alternatives."
"I am 82 yr old retired scientist, walking daily 4 miles in 1 hr. Suddenly I developed extreme arthritic pain in my right hip. Pain was unbearable at night. No pain killers helped including morphine. My doctor prescribed 200 mg Celebrex for 14 days. It helped instantly, particularly at night. Believe it or not, now I have pain in me left hip, my shoulders, elbows, and even severe pain in my left wrist! I have been off Celebrex for one week and I am relying on physical therapy to minimize the arthritic pain. No more Celebrex."
"The only thing the TEVA 200 mg brand of celecoxib did was make me sick. The medicine gave me diarrhea, heartburn to the point of reflux after 3 months of taking it & increased swelling & joint pain. I was relieved to be put on a different generic celecoxib, my joints improved & so did my stomach."
The only anti-inflammatory med I could take without side effects
"On Celebrex for one month now, still waiting on it to work.    NO  pain relief and no side effects."
"For 6 mths I've suffered chronic pain in the morning woken from sleep in pain in my joints. It started in my knees, then elbows & wrists. But 2 mths ago it started in my hips & lower back, & as my sleep was interrupted DAILY, so was my life. As soon I get up the pain would go, but the other day it wouldn't. So I went to my Dr who gave me Celebrex. I was scared to take it reading bad reviews. So I rang my Dr & he said take it & let me know how you feel tomorrow. I took it last night & can't believe I waited THIS long to try it. For the 1st time in 6 mths I woke with NO pain & it made me drowsy, which was a bonus. Celebrex WORKED for me so I want to write a POSITIVE review for people out there who are scared off by bad reviews. I'm pain free!"
Miserable RA flare after my mothers passing ! I went to the dr offerd methotrexate I refused I'm 37 no children ! I was in tears until Celebrex immediately I was up on my feet ! Thank you God ! I have my life back !
Does not work at all
"52 y/o male; I have dealt with joint pain 15 yrs. I dismissed as aging. Hands & knees really bad, & feet. Complained to Dr. over yrs. only to be dismissed. Last 3 yrs pain increased after walking, yard work. Get out of bed, hobble 5 min. before can walk. Have sporadic scalp psoriasis 20 yrs. Thanks to TV comm. by pro golfer Phil Mickelson, life's changed. I realized/suggested to Dr. I may have Psoriatic Arthritis. He agreed. Started me on Celebrex, 200mg x2. On for 1 mo now. Fixed all fore mentioned issues! Unbelievable! I've hauled 20 wheelbarrows of dirt from neighbors yard to mine, from across street! Couldn't have done a mo. ago. Worried its a black box drug through! No side effects, but maybe stomach (feeling bloated/funny).Will tapper off to 1xday"
5 weeks ago I had a full knee replacement.  The going was tough but I started taking celebrex and with therapy  I jogged down my driveway tonight.   (UNBELIEVABLE)  I stopped taking oxycodone.  I couldn't be more happier.  Now going back for a hip replacement.  All of this and I am 79 years old.
"I have muscle stiffness & pain at the base of my neck & head, which over time caused migraines & tension headaches. Botox & lidocaine injections have relieved the head pain. My doctor is still working on trigger points for the pain in a few sm areas of the upper neck. He prescribed Celebrex after Ibruprofen (did nothing) & Mobic (helped some). Celebrex helps the most. I believe It's bc Mobic is a selective COX2 inhibitor and the Celebrex is only COX2. It brings my pain down to between a 0-2, depending on whether I'm experiencing 24-hour soreness from the injections (2) or if it's just acting up from activites like yardwork or working too long at the computer (0). I've only been taking it for a month & good so far."
"An MRI showed spinal stenosis. Pain in my lower back, radiating down my leg into my thigh and knee. I limped when I walked and was in constant pain. My Dr prescribed 100mg once a day and within 24 hours I had pain relief. I took it for 2 weeks then went off of it just to see if there was a difference. I am here to tell you that I was back on it 2 days later. 
This medication is wonderful."
"My osteoarthritis of my left hip and lower back was so bad yesterday morning that I could barely walk and was having awful muscle spasms, but after taking 200 mg of celecoxib my pain virtually vanished within two hours = this is a miracle drug for osteoarthritis ... so far no side effects. I will be taking 200 mg each morning for prevention."
"All of the side effects mentioned in reading the warning, cold, numbness in leg, lower back pain, tingling in leg, hand I'm already experiencing these symptoms, plus I'm talking pain meds from pain management.  Scared to try this meds. my mother had a massive heart attack while on this medication. I'm terrified to even try this."
"I started taking a morning dose for 24 hours last Friday, 2/5/2016. Pain free immediately, but had very itchy areas. Had to stop taking due to intensity of itchy rash Monday morning 2/8/2016, but by 2pm, wish I had taken one this morning again!! ALMOST WORTH IT!"
"I was in a lot of pain in my lower back and shooting pain down my leg for months, and had increasing difficulty in walking and sleeping. I had been forced to use a cane, and a scooter to get around and I could no longer walk any distance.  I had to stop physical therapy because the pain was too bad and epidural injections seemed to offer little relief. The MRI indicated that I had tissue from a herniated disc and protruding disc was pressing on the nerves so I was scheduled for surgery. I was given a prescription for  Celebrex ( 250 mg/ 2 times/day) 8 weeks before surgery to help relieve the pain. One week before surgery, I was told to stop taking Celebrex.  The pain has not returned and the surgery was cancelled. I am now essentially pain"
"I am a 31 year old male US Army combat vet who suffers from arthritis. For years it went untreated and I was in pain every day all day until I was prescribed Celebrex, within a few days I felt better than I had in years. Upon waking in the morning I take 100mg's and within an hour or so I feel relief, if I miss a dose I can tell and I can feel it. I do not suffer any of the mentioned side affects after approximately 5 years. Of course it does not work for everyone but at this point I cannot live without it"
Doctor gave me Celebrex.I've been taking it for a week.  It does nothing for my hip pain (bone on bone arthritis). I'm going off it and back on Advil.
"I have been in pain for years. I did massage therapy, physiotherapy, yoga, ran, walked and weights.  Finally, my Doctor gave me a script for Celebrex - Instant pain relief in both my neck and lumbar. It is November 11, 2015 and I am going to celebrate tonight. I am pain FREE!"
1 pill every 24 hours VERY convenient. Is not near as hard on stomach and intestines. Works about as well as Aleve or Ibuprofen if you take them every 4 hours.
"I went to the doctor with fluid around my knee.  At this point it was stiff and only a little sore. 5 days later, I have stopped taking it because my knee has become painful and useless.  I also started developing bruises easily.   This is easily the worst medication I have ever taken (along with Clindamycin in a close second)."
"I went they 2 years of hell with lower back pain it ruined my life for those 2 years seemingly endless pain and suffering .  Then my doctor prescribed Celebrex, which stopped the pain dead in its tracks"
"At 17 years old I have finally seen a rheumatologist. I got, a shot of corticosteroid which immediately made my knee and back feel 100% better. And a starter pack with 12 Celebrex samples. The celebrex didn't cause any noticeable side effects and the pain eased. I finally have my own prescription of Celebrex. I take it every now and then if the pain is not bearable. But I like to just ride out with no medication because I'm used to the flare ups. I feel weird about taking Celebrex everyday because it is a black box drug; I'm too young to start damaging my liver. All in all; Celebrex works when you need it."
Worked like magic for my Mom. She can now move around without pain and do the things she coundn't do before.
"I think it is great for osteo-arthritis of hip - but others work for me equally well e.g. Mobic, Voltaren.  I chose Celebrex as I have read it is gentler on stomach and kidneys.  The only downside is the fear I get reading about heart problems - so I change every few months an alternate the meds - with a week off in between (when I go back to limping).  But I have no problems - in fact I did notice that Celebrex takes a few days to work whereas Mobic and Voltaren are almost instant"
"I have OA in my hands, knee, and spine.  I have been taking Celebrex for over 12 years.  I have slightly high blood pressure.  It could be from Celebrex but the benefits of Celebrex outweigh the possible side effects I have experienced.  I am having a second spine fusion in a week and have to stop taking Celebrex, per my doctor's request.  I have read more positives to keep taking it through and after surgery...I dread going off it because I will not be able to use my hands.  Celebrex improves my quality of life and I recommend anyone with severe arthritis to give it a try"
Diagnosed 1.5 years ago. Was on Mobic for a year until it became somewhat ineffective in my left hip to the point where I could barely walk. Switched to Celebrex which is doing a lot better.. have been taking it for 6 months but I know long term effects of NSAIDS are damaging so trying no starch diet to get off NSAIDs..so far little success but need to stick to it for much longer.
"Celebrex is the ONLY medicine that signifcantly relieves my knee pain and allows me to walk in almost complete comfort. I take as needed, not everyday, per my doctor's recommendation, since I have high blood pressure (controlled with medicine) and high cholesterol, and have not taken it for longer than one month in a row without taking a significant break from the medicine afterward. However I will take 1 x 200 mg pill if I have a particularly active day ahead of me. I am 70 and have had no significant side effects."
"Very effective, reduced pain to very low level, I was on Celebrex for 3 years on and off depending on severity of pain and had no problems, as pain got more prolonged I took 200mg on a daily basis. At about 6 months I devoloped  increased ringing in the ears, followed by hearing noises which couldn't be explained by a specialist hearing Doctor"
I have extremely painful periods. I'm talking pain so bad I cry and want to go to ER. I was given this to help with arthritis. And just happen to start same day well I took one and they are doable now I'm not doubled over crying. Don't get me wrong it still hurts but not nearly as bad.
"After breaking both ankles in 1987, I was diagnosed with arthritis in 1997, I put up with mild pain and joint stiffness for years until I started my new job in 2011 at age 45, (7-8 hours a day non stop on my feet) after each shift I would be in so much excruciating pain I wondered if the job was worth it. Went to see my doctor who prescribed 100mg Celebrex twice a day, first few days I noticed a small improvement but also had a bit of stomach discomfort. After a few weeks it was like I had new ankles! Little to no pain, so I went down to 100mg a day on days I don't work and 200mg a day when I work. Only other side effect I have had is significant hair loss/ thinning for a couple weeks every 6 months, it grows back though."
"I'm a 59 year old woman with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and I've been taking this medication for 3 months with no side effects at all. And I was expecting some so I've been pleasantly surprised. It does help with the pain but we are just getting into the cold, rainy season and time will tell just how much of a difference it really makes as this is when I'm in the most pain."
"Having chronic knee pain due to hockey injuries that has been getting worse and worse as I turned 50 - but now using 200 mg Celebrex each day has been nothing short of 100% recovery. I can now take the stairs, exercise and play hockey pain free with no side effects.  Awesome, awesome."
"I have debilitating pains from my costochrondritis for years. I have tried naproxen, Mobic, and Voltaren gel with no relief. My rheumatologist then suggested Celebrex. This has been a lifesaver. Celebrex has made my chest pains go from a 9-10 to about a 0-1. I would recommend this medicine to anyone dealing with costochrondirits. Even the price is not bad. I pay 60 dollars for a 90 day supply."
"I have had bilateral knee replacements and severe multiple joint pains problems.  I have been around the block with all sorts of medications to help me with pain & inflammation. This includes getting and becoming addicted to pain medication. I have not taken Celebrex because at the time my problems were so bad, they were pulling all the cox 2 inhibitors off the markets. I have been on Celebrex now for slightly over a month! What a God send! I am absolutely AMAZED at how well this has worked. Please give it a chance, you will be extremely satisfied!! Pfizer offers help paying for this RX. I have a $10 copayment but with help card $4.00!! Can't beat that!"
"I take Celebrex when I'm really in pain with my arthritis, works very well. Scared of the side effects of irregular heart beat as I have a heart murmur. I have had none so far. Really good medication if you're in pain."
"I took this drug for three months and it worked wonderfully for the pain. However, after three months, I lost bowel control, which is a possible side effect."
I am scheduled for knee replacement in a few weeks and my doctor prescribed Celebrex for me to take daily starting the day before surgery.  I have been suffering with osteoarthritis for years.  I am only 57 years old but my knees are so bad I walk like I am 90 years old.  In addition to my knees I suffer with joint pain all over my body.  I filled my prescription using the Celebrex discount card that I received from my doctor.  My co pay with insurance was only $4.00.  Without the discount card it would have cost $50.00.  I decided to try the Celebrex now disregarding my doctors instructions. My very first day of taking Celebrex I noticed a big difference in my joint pain.  I am on day three and my pain is much improved.  Thank God!
"I take celebrex for costochrondritis (inflammation of the cartilage in the sternum). It is very painful and can be debilitating. After being on mobic, naproxen and other NSAIDs with no help, my rheumatologist put me on celebrex. It has been amazing. My pain went from about a 7 or 8 to a 1-2. I take it in the morning. This has been the best thing for my chest pain. Although the only issue is the price. But I would rather spend the money than have chest pains"
"Reduced pain in my C2 but caused nausea, sinus pain, runny nose, cough, when taking 100mg daily, and severely increased symptoms when dose increased to 200 mg daily for one day.  "
"I'm going to eventually have to have hip surgery, but Celebrex is the only medication that currently reduces my right hip pain to the point where I have restored quality of life."
"I took 2 Advil for 5 yrs to alleviate arthritis pain.  My hip/groin pain got so bad, I finally went to see a Doc.  He prescribed Celebrex..  It works GREAT for my hands.... but not my hip. Someone suggested taking Tylenol WITH the Celebrex -- MUCH better results. I take l,000 mg of Tylenol and 200 mg Celebrex, daily.  I hope by Summer the heat will help my arthritis and I can cut back on the Tylenol.  Celebrex is very expensive. I wish the results had been a lot better for me but as a professional pianist, I'm SO grateful that it works great on my hands."
"I am 59 year old female. I have sport related injuries and have been suffering arthritis pain in both knees and hip for several years. Tried not to take medication all my life. Do not drink alcohol, tried chiropractic, tried massage therapy, do yoga regularly. But the pain was taking away my ability to enjoy life constant pain is a terrible thing. I have been taking Celebrex for approximately 1 week. I am sleeping better moving better and the pain has been reduced by at least 50%. Hoping to get my active life back. FINGERS CROSSED. Good Luck to fellow pain suffers this is definitely worth trying. Work with it. Don't drink alcohol. Eat something when you take it. I am on 2x200mg and will try to get that down to 1x. I tried 1x at first   No Joy."
The problem I ran into however was it's side effects.  I had to stop taking it as it affected my breathing to the point that I couldn't walk half a block without gasping for air.  To this day I still have respiratory problems after taking this.
I agree with those who say Celebrex has improved quality of life.  I joked with my doctor that Celebrex is the only anti-depressant that ever worked for me. Chronic pain is depressing.  I have been on this medication for over a decade and my joints still move with ease - and without disabling pain. I am grateful.
"I'm a 41-year-old male and for the last few years I started suffering from many of my gym and sports-related injuries. At first, it was the pain I associated with too much work at the gym or too many miles on the trail, or picking up too much weight for my arthritic lower back, etc., but when my elbows both shut down completely at exactly the same time, and I couldn't hold a tube of toothpaste anymore, I started to freak out. For months I took way too many OTC NSAIDs, prescription pain killers, steroids, on and on and nothing came close to relieving the pain. I became angry and depressed and was a complete grump. Then my Dr. prescribed Celebrex and it is nothing short of amazing. My quality of life has greatly improved. It's expensive though."
I already used Celebrex for several years if I have pains.
Use it when I play golf. It really works for me. Takes away all of the pain in my knee.
"I still have to take Advil, or Aleve in addition to Celebrex."
"Have been taking about 3 weeks (200mg/daily). Started having irregular heartbeats after about 2 weeks. Stopped taking and it cleared up, I started taking again and irregular heartbeats have returned. I guess I will have to stop, what a shame--- it really helps the pain!!!
	"
"I feel as though I've been given a second chance at living. I am enjoying life for the first time in many years. I will be dropping off my walker, crutches and chair lift at the Goodwill this week (you may think I'm kidding--I'm serious). I do fear that the change might be temporary  but, I'm going to enjoy everything while the pain is gone! (Five weeks pain free)."
"Celebrex is great for pain, ten out of ten - but for me, it has unwanted side effects, such as stomach bloat and hair loss. I was on it for 3 years, and came off of it, and now I am back on it because of the pain.  But, I am going to try some other osteoarthritis medicines, and hope for less side effects. I'm female and the side effects of Celebrex are terrible."
"I took 200mg 1 per day, for osteoarthritis in my hands. The pain relief was amazing. I could sleep through the night, and wake rested, and was thrilled to have nearly pain free use of my hands. After 1 week I began to develop an irregular heartbeat. First day, it wasn't too noticeable, and I was able to ignore the feeling. The irregularity increased, that night it was difficult to sleep. Next day I spoke to the doctor who did an EKG. He said I was having  Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC). He advised I stop taking the Celebrex immediately. It took 4 days for the PVCs to subside. After waiting 2 weeks, I tried taking Celebrex again. After 3 days, the PVCs returned. Stopped the medicine, PVCs stopped. "
"I am 49 years old, my mother is in hospital with 2 knee replacement and I have noticed over the years I too have pain in my knees after years of then cracking as I walked upstairs. Then the pain got worse so I went to the doc and he told me to try Celebrex 300 mg a day and let me tell you so far no side effects and I am happy again. The wife says I am acting strange, she's never seen me so happy but its not for all. For me I wish I would have done this a lot sooner. "
"I have osteoarthritis, primarily in my hands.  On and off over the past 8 years, I've used Celebrex for flare-ups and can feel pain-free almost immediately!  It is a miracle for any and all of my aches & pains.  No negative side effects for me either.  The only part is it's expense but today I found several websites that offer coupons for it."
I have taken 200mg twice daily for several years. My Dr. keeps trying to lower my dose to once a day. I have tried & found my mobility is severely compromised. I don't seem to have any side effects and it works for me.
"I have been on Celebrex off and on, over the last 10 years or more. I take it mainly for lower back pain. I understand it increases your chance of heart attack and stroke, so I take it only when I need it. It is hard on your stomach, so take it after a meal. But it really helps ease my lower back pain. I don't understand why the price for my prescription was $300.   this month. It's never been that high! That's why I'm here, looking to see if there is an explanation. The chemist told me to call my insurance company, as he didn't know. Its a good medicine but its so expensive now I'll probably have to phase it out."
"I was given some samples of Celebrex from my physician for wrist and hand pain.  After I took the second capsule of 200 mg, I awoke in the night with an extremely bad headache, had the chills, aching muscles, runny nose and a dry hacking cough.  I stopped taking the pills, but as my symptoms persisted, I believed I had the flu.  Three weeks later, I again tried Celebrex and on the second day of taking the pills, I was again stricken with chills, a headache, nausea and the runny nose.  These symptoms have stayed with me for the past three days.  "
I had great relief of the pain issue but I gained 40 pounds in 3 months. My weight has been stable for 15 years until I began gaining weight overnight. The sudden weight gain is worse than the initial pain so I have discontinued taking Celebrex.
I was given Celebrex for arthritis in my knee. After taking it for about two weeks I started to notice not only was my knee better and I was able to resume all of my normal activities with no pain but my foot that I had been suffering from planter fasciitis for two and a half years was finally not hurting. I had been through every treatment  and three different foot doctors with no relief at all. Celebrex is by far the best medicine I have taken it has given me back my life in more ways then one.
I am a 76 year old female and have been taking Celebrex on and off for many years.  When my arthritis gives me pain I take it for about 2 or 3 weeks and the pain is gone.  Right now I have been taking it everyday for the last 3 months because I need a knee replacement and I am practically free of pain.  I highly recommend Celebrex for any kind of pain.  I have had no side effects.
This medicine is really great for pain. Down side makes my blood pressure rise.
Very expensive but worth it. I've have football knees and a bad back. This cleans up the stiffness and gets things circulating. Eat right after you take it. I have been taking this for years and I'd be lost without it.
"A few years before I went through menopause. I used to have incredible pain, headache and felt like my Lymph Nodes were going to burst out of my throat 3 days before my menstruation and when I started to take this it worked totally. I had tried all kinds of pain killers but nothing made any difference. My doctor had prescribed it for my back pain originally. So one day I decided to try take it for my menstrual pain and was amazed that it worked so well for my Lymph Nodes and headache as well."
"This is the only medicine that works for me.  I have tried many many others with no effect. I have MS and in pain all the time.  Arthritis in my spine is very painful, and this really helps me."
"I love this medication, I would be lost with out it. I have degeneration of the spine and this causes a lot of swelling. Before Celebrex  I couldn't get out of bed without taking pain meds first and giving them time to work. Now with Celebrex I can get right up, I move like I did 10 years ago. "
Didn't do much for me.
Did not help my back pain.
"After a year of back pain this is a miracle, except for indigestion and gastric discomfort after a week of use. I take medicine to minimize the indigestion."
"I have had back pain (mid-back and shoulder and neck pain) for 10 years or more everyday. I have had 3 cortisone shots in my shoulder. I have massages every month and go to the chiropractor when it is bad. I finally caved in and went to the doctor and got Celebrex 200mg once a day, and Omega 3. I have taken it for 10 days now and have never felt better. I cannot believe I have no pain. Why did I wait so long? I am 50 years old."
I commenced Celebrex 100mgs twice a day following shoulder surgery. Aided freer movement but causing increased restlessness and reflux.
"I have severe osteoarthritis of the right knee and was facing a certain total knee replacement.  As a last resort for pain relief, I tried Celebrex 200 mg.  For about two months, there was no impact on pain or improved knee function.  Then (as if by magic), the constant pain went away and my knee function returned to just about normal. I now have the ability to exercise and move like the whole thing never happened! I'm certainly glad I stuck with the medication, as it's been almost a miracle.  Now, I have to decide whether to proceed with knee replacement, or will Celebrex buy me a few more years."
"I need a new knee and get Synvisc shots every 6 months. Not so much pain, but often uncomfortable and the knee is very useless after about 4 months. Found Celebrex and took it. As package said, it took a couple of weeks to do much, but then woke up pain free one morning. Amazing. I have a very stressful job though and seem to have developed a heart condition. Did Celebrex contribute? I do not know, but have discontinued its use."
"I've had two bad knee surgeries and was left option-less by my orthopedist so I left and went to a pain doctor. I was prescribed Celebrex after trying nearly all the other NSAIDs and have taken it for 6 months. I'm not painless, but it has worked miracles from where I was, and I know when I've forgotten to take it."
"For pain and swelling of my joints it worked the best, but my blood pressure went up and heart disease runs in my family.  I wish I could have continued taking it."
"A very good medicine that works for my knee pain, sometimes I do have to top it up with Tylenol Arthritis. All in all I recommend it for osteoarthritis."
"I started having extreme joint pain almost overnight and was like that for over 2 weeks.  The Doctor put me on Celebrex, 2 pills 2 times a day for 5 days with 1 pill once a day since.  I feel so much better and no side effects, not even an upset stomach. I'm so happy there is a pain medication that is not a steroid or narcotic."
"I have a disc protrusion at c4-5 and c5-6 which causes a narrowing in the foriminal which causes nerve root pain.  In May of 2009 I was in excruciating pain and through the advice of my chiropractor he suggested that I mention to my spine specialist the medication Celebrex.  My specialist said let's give it a try, and WOW what a miracle.  I went from extreme pain, I wasn't even able to sleep on my left side, couldn't walk due to pain running down from my shoulder to my left thumb.  I couldn't even bend to shave my legs.  Well other than a little stomach irritation in the beginning, I have little to no pain. My insurance picks up the price of the medicine with me having to pay a nominal copay of $45.00.  I can now exercise, ride my bike."
"I don't like using medicines at all, especially long-term, but Celebrex did tame my symptoms enough for me to be able to pursue other therapies.  It wasn't perfect. I still limped and had some pain and stiffness issues but it made a world of difference.  I am now off of it, and have taken a big hit in my flexibility and mobility. 

"
I woke up one morning unable to walk and in horrible pain after a day out walking on the board walk. I took everything I could think of. Finally took Celebrex and within one hour the pain was gone. 
On 400 mg a day and it works great in regards to my synovitis pain in all my joints that my lupus causes. No side effects after taking it for two months. I prefer taking this over prednisone any day.
I am a newly diagnosed osteoarthritis sufferer. I felt so depressed when I started reading about my condition. I feel so hopeless right now. My doctor prescribed me to take Celebrex twice a day for three days. The pain has severely reduced and no side effects so far.
I have a 50% compression fracture of my L1 and Celebrex is the only thing that will alleviate the pain. Unfortunately it upsets my stomach.
"After my two total hip replacements I still have chronic pain due to having avascular necrosis. I rely on Celebrex to literally allow me to be able to walk. I received some samples in 2006 following my second surgery. My doctor at that time had enough samples so that I was taking them on a regular basis. Only after a short period without them did we realize to what extent they were helping me. I sincerely believe that I could not live a normal life without the Celebrex. It scares me to think that one day I may not be able to get it due to not being able to afford it. My co-pay is $60.00 for Celebrex every month and it is hard to do. I tell anyone I can what Celebrex has done for me, with absolutely no side effects."
"Have been on Celebrex for a year.  Initially for TMJ issues, then picked up mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis last summer.  Been on it continuously except for a couple month long steroid regimens. I wouldn't call it a miracle medicine, but it knocks my inflammation and pain back about 60%.  Certainly not as effective as the steroid, but 60% is enough to keep me fully functional and unlike the steroid, I have minimal to zero side effects with it."
"I envy the people who have had success with Celebrex.  I need both knees replaced for osteoarthritis, and I also have pain in my back, neck, elbows, hips and wrists.  I've been on Celebrex for 6 or 7 years.  When I first used it, it used to make me very dizzy.  But it NEVER ever relieved any pain for me!

I always had to pop multiple Tylenol, Motrin or Advil to supplement, in order to get even minimum relief.

My doctor put me on Arthrotec today, and I am really hoping for success.  If that doesn't work, he's going to try me on Tylenol-3 (codeine-based)."
"Prescribed for back pain caused by crushed vertebra (I am trying to avoid surgery as long as possible).  After three days of taking Celebrex I bent over for the first time in two years without nursing my back.  I was amazed and thrilled.  However, on the fifth day I noticed I had broken out in small rashes all over and was forced to discontinue taking it."
Caused severe stomach upset - a trip to the emergency department was necessary.
"About a year ago I started having symptoms of RA (seronegative).  I started on prednisone 20mg which helped somewhat but I was having flare ups in the ankles and hands.  Finally got switched to Celebrex because the pain and swelling were not going away. 200mg daily - all I can say is it's been like night and day since I started taking it - less pain, less swelling, better days!"
This is the only medicine which helps with my osteoarthritis pain.
"I've been taking it for 2 months, 200 mg daily. The first 2 weeks were great, all pain was gone. The pain gradually came back and I had so many flare ups even when I was taking it.  My doctor just gave me Prednisone 20 mg daily to combine with Celebrex. I started yesterday and most of the pain has gone, however, my doctor advised not to take Prednisone for more than one week in order to prevent having the serious side effects, such as bone problems."
I have been taking Celebrex from August 4. Nothing has happened for me yet. Today is September 10 2010. Maybe it works for some and doesn't work for some. 
"I'm very pleased with Celebrex for the neck and knee pain caused by my osteoarthritis. I have no pain on climbing up and down the stairs (relief began after only several days). I not only have no neck pain, but also a dramatically increased range of motion...which makes it much safer for me to change lanes when I'm driving. The one problem I have is that I must take the medication after eating, otherwise tummy tenderness may occur."
"Celebrex has helped me manage my back pain, lumbar and cervical, due to degenerative arthritis. NOT taking it, is noticeable, have increase of pain and functionally impaired condition without it."
"I have flare-ups of arthritis in my knees. I am an 80 year old female.  I take Celebrex only as needed, at about 3 month intervals. When I have a problem walking, I take Celebrex 1 table a day for three days - it is like a miracle drug.  It does away with the knee pain and I am back to walking as I need to.  I have had NO side effects so far. I think it is a miracle drug.  Not everyone has had the same good fortune but this works for me and I keep it on hand for this limited use."
"This medication has worked great for me in the past, then my insurance did not want to pay for it. My experience with Celebrex had me pain free."
"Used to treat chronic pain (idiopathic origin, but could be fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue).  Ease of use was fine, only side effects were stomach upset. "
"I would not do without it.  It has helped me now for over 3 years along with Tramadol. I can hardly walk in the mornings but after I take my medicines I can walk, run, dance, etc. Like I said, I need the Celebrex in my life or I'm no good."
"I LOVE Celebrex!  I have degenerative disk disease, bulged disk and degenerative hips.  My doctor had me try it after learning how I can tolerate 6 ibupropen a day.  I have been 85% better as far as the daily pain.  I can do things in exercise that I could not before, due to the pain.  I take homeopathic anti inflammatory supplements as well.  I am a 43 year old photographer, pilates student and teacher living in pain for over 6 years.  So wonderful to have this relief."
I knew that I had an arthritis since I started College. Since then I'm suffering from it after my doctor told me to take this medicine. Thanks to Celebrex my suffering has ended. This medicine is great!
"I'm 21 years old and the doctor told me I have arthritis (I found out from another doctor I do NOT) but they put me on this to help with the pain (from my car accident, not from arthritis) and it did NOT work. It made me have lots of bloody stool and severe abdominal pain. It barely reduced the pain.
"
"I'm 17 years old and last year I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I was switched to 200mg of Celebrex three months ago instead of taking 20mg of prednisone a day. And all I can say is that Celebrex has made my life almost normal again. I can go back to school and hang out normally with my friends again. Even if it might only be short term, Celebrex has saved my life."
"Based on 200 mg 1 per day; only thing I got was heart burn, no pain relief. Tried to take everyother day, didn't make any difference still got horrible heart burn.  Switched to Mobic."
Helps very much with pain but is causing skin itching on my arms.
"Tried Tylenol with codeine, physical therapy (14 sessions), and cortisone injection directly into left sacroiliac joint.  No relief from severe night pain in left lower back and buttocks until Celebrex.  2 days of 2 pills/day, no more pain.  A true miracle!  I feel like 'me' again!"
"Having severe menstrual pain since age 16 (before hysterectomy), Costochondritis (inflammation of the ribs-for 20 years), osteo-\arthritis (cervical spine-most of my adult life), pre & post-surgical rotator cuff & biceps tear and fibromyalgia (18  years). Celebrex was prescribed by my Rheumatologist as soon as it came on the market. Having tried many prescription and OTC anti-inflammatory medicines, since age 16. The side effects of the digestive upsets increased through the years. Regardless, my specialist explained that I would experience the same level of relief as the previous medications except that it was less likely to cause the side effects. My digestive issues resolved and pain relief lasts longer with 1 capsule. "
I have been taking this medicine for just over a week now for lower back pain due to a bulging disc and I found no relief.
"After my d&c last year, I had celebrex 200mg as needed for pain daily x 7 days. It was great. Last week after I had an endo-ablation. I was the first one to ask my doctor; for celebrex again. It is one of the best non-narcotic pain medication."
I had been suffering form severe knee pain after undergoing a knee surgery. After using this pain relief medication Celebrex I am comfortable. This medication is an wonderful medication for pain relief.
"I tried Celebex for degenerative disc disease, and for pain associated with upper back surgery (spinal fusion). It didn't work well. And because I was in a stressful profession my doctors worried about heart issues associated with Celebrex. I changed to Norco 7.5/325 5 years ago and it has worked very well along with physical therapy. I'm a 53 year old male."
"So far, so good."
Very helpful for knee osteoarthritis
"I take Celebrex for tendinitis (in my elbows and ankles). Pain and swelling stopped within one day of taking 400mg, and I have been free of pain for several months. I now take a 200 mg capsule only when needed (and that isn't often)."
I was on Celebrex for over two years as treatment for pain following a severe back injury. I am over 50 years old and Celebrex was very effective. I was referred to another doctor who replaced Celebrex with Tridural. Celebrex is my choice but I have to follow my doctor's instructions.
"Celebrex has been really great for my arthritis and
Ankylosing Spondylitis.  I can actually function almost
normally with about half the prescribed dosage (which
is normally 2 per day).  The one pill will take care of the
pain for about 36-40 hrs."
I'm a 52 yr old male with a weak left Sacroiliac joint and often get a nerve pinch (L5L6) that's cause shooting pain down my leg or difficulty standing up straight. I take Celebrex for 2-4 days and it clears right up. It's been amazing for me.
"I've been through 3 other types of NSAIDs before I was prescribed Celebrex. It works great for me, and the side effects have been pretty mild compared to the previous ones."
I have been taking Celebrex for a little over 2 years. I was having severe knee pain due to my arthritis. This is the only medication that reduced that pain significantly. My doctor prescribed it when nothing else worked.
Celebrex did nothing for my pain.
Celebrex has helped me now for over 5 years. I have Arthritis in one old disc injury and pain in the next one. I have tried nearly all of them and nothing worked as well as this. Just don`t know how long to continue but I am only 49. I take 400 per day. 
"I have had back problems for almost forever.  Recently, my doctor preferred me to take an over-the-counter instead of Celebrex because of potential heart-related issues.  I tried to do so, but my condition did not get better.  I used Celebrex and it helped very much.  Sometimes less is more:  I needed less Celebrex (6) versus lots of the other stuff."
"If Celebrex ever falls to the legislative chopping block I will be the first in line in Washington to keep Celebrex available.
If I had to eliminate all but one of the fifteen (I don't believe it myself) medications I am currently taking then the keeper would be Celebrex.
I've suffered from chronic pain and fatigue for over fifteen years now. After going through the roster of pain killers Celebrex was like a godsend. Instead of a massive area of pain that ran through my head, down through my neck and into my shoulder blades and upper arms I found that I had half a dozen distinct areas of pain consistent with the areas of damage from accidents and injuries.
I have no side effects with the two 200mg taken twelve hours apart."
I have pain in my legs and when I take the medicine it help enormously.  I have had this problem until I started doing kickboxing.
"Works great for me, but I don't understand why the Dr's won't put me on it."
Celebrex really helps the pain in my legs.
I have been taking Celebrex now for a little over 30 days. I am 30 years old and have suffered from chronic arthritis pain for over 10 years. I have had two ankle surgeries leaving me with what feels like no relief. My last surgery was over 2 years ago and did provide SOME relief but not completely. Since I?ve been on Celebrex I can honestly say it?s been a blessing in disguise!!! I went from 2-3 days a week of pain and discomfort to virtually none.
I have had chronic pain and tried many medicines including narcotics to help. Celebrex has helped me so much. I am able to do so many things that I couldn't before. My doctor has me taking it with Tylenol w/Codeine #3 and Carisoprodol.
"I had been suffering with knee pain and severe plantar fasciitis pain for a long time. Nothing would help the pain and my heel pain was just brutal at times it had been going on for months. I ask my doctor about trying Celebrex and finally she agreed to it. Within a few days I could notice a difference in the pain level, and after two weeks on it, the generic version, my pain level has gone from like an eight or nine out of ten to down to a four or five most days. I would definitely recommend it though I do highly recommend taking it with food as it does mess up your guts sometimes LOL"
"It did help the pain in my thumbs almost immediately but after taking 200 mg once daily for one week I became very dizzy and fell hitting my head, had to have stitches but it is okay now. I was experiencing dizziness about every night in bed but didn’t know why but after that extreme dizzy spell and fall I decided it was the celecoxib so I quit taking it and now have no more dizziness. I’m afraid to take it now."
"There are many different reactions to this medication according to people but I would still highly recommend giving it a try. I have taken 200mg of Celebrex for years and had minimal, if any, side effects. I have had both knees replaced and this medication enables me to function at a reasonable level. At one point I didn't take it for a week and reverted to each movement of my legs becoming painful and difficult. Within a week of resuming it, I felt fine and able to resume my busy schedule. I haven't noted any side effects but again, each person may react differently. But do weigh your options and try it as it may help decrease your long term pain."
"Been on Celebrex 20+ years for severe OA (five joint replacements, spinal stenosis with several spondylolistheses) Been a Godsend, works better than any narcotic for my daily pain. Unfortunately my kidneys have taken a hit but I can't live without the relief Celebrex gives me."
"very bad side effects. constipation, bloating, nausea, dizziness."
Pinched nerve in neck/back. Taking 200mg once a day and in conjunction with paracetamol. Doesn’t even touch the sides for pain relief.
"Celebrex is the only pain medicine, including everything from ibuprofen to morphine, that has ever helped my pain caused by endometriosis. I’ve been in the hospital for this pain getting multiple doses of morphine with no real reduction in pain but one Celebrex takes it to a manageable level every time. I am currently using it to manage the pain of miscarriage. I understand that this medication is not right for everyone, but it can really work for certain people like myself. It is expensive and hard to get my hands on as doctors usually don’t want to prescribe it, but I’d always rather have this over narcotics which don’t work well for me at all."
Took it for inflammation due to hernia repair surgery... gave me extreme stomach cramps and gas that traveled to every inch of my body that it could. I felt sharp tightness around my chest and it was a strain to talk and breath.
"My Dad go treated for prostate cancer 4 years ago .. late last year he started having difficulties working with hip pain .. he was taken to the hospital and he started using Celebrex with other prescribed drugs like contiflo Od ,casodex, after 1week he started working perfectly before he resumed his radiotherapy"
"Hives. I suffered with hives for 3 1/2 years and was told I was not allergic to anything. The antihistamines did NOTHING. However, Celebrex actually took them away and after 5 months, I am hive free. Being an anti-inflamatory is probably what makes it work."
Caution check box it says CELEBREX but look at small print is it CELECOXIB capsules then it’s is generic and does not work. Nothin’ nada.
"I was prescribed this for inflammation and pain after surgery. While although it was effective, I quit taking due to horrible stomach problems and diahhrea. It really helped with the inflammation but the cons outweighed the pros and I discontinued use. I was prescribed 200 mg/day."
"I was in pain for nearly two month, back and joint pain. The doctor prescribed Celebrex 200mg twice daily. After two weeks of taking it along with Melatonin at night to ease sleep I'm happy to say that I'm 90% recovered. I finished the two week course and waited an additional 4 days before writing this review. Did not face any scary side effects all minor, it gets very easy on third day of use. Don't be afraid to try it."
"I take it for arthritis and lower pain in my back and upper neck pain and hip pain that's related to stenosis. It's been moderately effective. I've taken Celebrex for several years with short breaks in between for various reasons none of which was because of it not working. It was for medical procedures is the reason for short breaks. I can tell when I don't take Celebrex, the pain returns with a vengeance."
"It wasn’t until recently that I started taking Celebrex 200 mg 1x per day in conjunction with Small rose of Lyrica 5 mg to treat my fibromyalgia and chronic knee pain from surgery and injuries. Before the new treatment I felt awful! I had been seeing my orthopedic specialist and he had me on a combination of Celebrex and tramadol, which did not seem to help! But then I started feeling pain throughout my body and felt tired all of the time so that prompted me to visit my primary care. He sent me to a specialist and after some tests diagnosed me with fibromyalgia, this the new prescription of Lyrica with instructions to stop taking the Tramadol. Within 2 days, I felt a huge difference. I’m not a big fan of medicines, but I am so grateful to have finally gotten some pain relief. Thank you Lord and thank you to my doctors!"
"Ive been in pain for years. Morning stiffness so severe I cant get up. I couldnt walk. Ive been on humira and its not working. A friend of mine brought over Celebrex. And a 90 mg pill of CBD oil. I got up 30 minutes later and cleaned my wholw house. Woke up this morning and walked my dogs!! Im mad I wasnt prescribed this before! I didnt take CBD today , only celebrex, and i feel AMAZING"
"Doctor wanted me to try Celebrex as I had been taking Prednisone off and on for the last year. I recently was prescribed Tramadol, which he isn't fond of prescribing. Took one dose at 11am and by 9pm that night, I happened to notice considerable swelling in my calves and ankles (also referred to as ""cankles"") I did not take another dose and called my doctor's office in the morning and informed them what happened and that I would not be taking anymore. I also didn't have much reduction in pain."
"Was on Celebrex 100mg twice a day to deal with osteoarthritis in my knees which after 10 days had made no difference to the pain but had noticed blood in my stools (which oddly never happened with ibuprofen), had a sore throat for several days then felt shattered. Dose upped to 200mg twice a day to alleviate pain but didn't notice any difference apart from an increase in the side effects. Have since come off this and had some weird effects such as a massive increase in the pain more so than I ever had before taking Celebrex, plus I felt dizzy and utterly exhausted for a couple of days."
Had total hip replacement was prescribed by surgeon. Took for 8 weeks after because I didn't use opiods. Did a good job. Stop taking because effects of drugs are worse than the pain from arthritis that I have been dealing with for over 25 years. Didn't have any bad side effects.
"Broke out in rash on both legs, from ankles to knees....now do not take this drug at all."
I stopped taking for 2 weeks and was in severe pain so started back and no pain
"I have repetitive motion injuries in both my elbows (cubital tunnel) due to years of material handling jobs. Also sprained my shoulders a time or two. Celebrex works, my hips don't hurt now either and after years of walking on concrete floors, that's been an issue. This medication has been a real help for me. I'm sensitive to aspirin but have had no problems. I was so exhausted from not being able to get a decent nights sleep that I was borderline homicidal. Now I can rest, the only thing that would make it better is if it stopped hot flashes. My doctor gave me the generic version and so the cost is lower than my usual prescription costs. For those with joint pain, I highly recommended it."
Celebrex is awesome! Have been taking it only one week for severe bilateral knee pain! Pain is completely gone. Unbelievable! No side effects so far.
Doctor prescribed Celebrex for knee pain because I am taking 10 mg warfarin daily. Ibuprofen and diclofenac helped the knee pain the best but could not take it due to contraindications with warfarin. No relief from celebrex at all.
"Worked right away to alleviate almost all of my arthritis pain. With the exception of my worst arthritic finger, I no longer have pain in my hands or neck. It's been an excellent option for me."
"I am very sensitive to meds. I was on naproxen and experienced anger, anxiety with very little pain relief. First few days on Cellebrex were a miracle. Instant relief and flying high. No anxiety like I had on naproxen. However after about a month, I started to feel I was in a fog and really tired. I was napping every day and exhausted most of the time with a constant minor headache. My rheumatologist switched me to Meloxicam and it is not as strong for the pain relief and is slower to start working, but no more naps for me. Feeling only a little edgy and much more energetic. I think Cellebrex works great short term."
Works for me. Almost complete elimination of pain.
I awoke yesterday morning with terrible pain in my left hip and lower back due to osteoarthritis. I could barely walk without experiencing awful spasms. I took a 200mg capsule of celecoxib and within 2 hours the pain had virtually diminished. I would highly recommend this drug to anyone with osteoarthritis.
gave me headache lasted all day after taking 3 pills
Dizziness fatigue not hungry then ravished
"""I was in a lot of pain in my lower back and shooting pain down my leg for months, and had increasing difficulty in walking and sleeping. I had been forced to use a cane, and a scooter to get around and I could no longer walk any distance. I had to stop physical therapy because the pain was too bad and epidural injections seemed to offer little relief. The MRI indicated that I had tissue from a herniated disc and protruding disc was pressing on the nerves so I was scheduled for surgery. I was given a prescription for Celebrex ( 250 mg/ 2 times/day) 8 weeks before surgery to help relieve the pain. One week before surgery, I was told to stop taking Celebrex. The pain has not returned and the surgery was cancelled. I am now essentially pain free. Now that I have been on Celebrex for two months I am now taking just 1 pill a day and will soon try to stop taking it, as I have improved that much. I do take Protonix and have for quite some time, so that may be why I have not noticed any side affects. Anyway before opting for back surgery and fusion I would suggest trying this drug. I saw improvement just after a week. If no improvement after 3 weeks, then you should obviously stop ta"
"I only took for one month, but saw NO signs of improvement. It is VERY expensive! Will not recommend to anyone."
"Whoever wrote ""There have been no reports of sulfa-allergic patients reacting to Celebrex"". is clueless. I got a sulfa rash within a few weeks of taking the drug. Real ""smart"" of the FDA to outlaw all other cox-2 alternatives (that are freely available in the ""civilized"" world)."
"I have been on Celebrex for approximately 8 years. I have been trying to find a replacement, but the doctors state that there is nothing that has so little side effects and so much pain relief. At last I spoke to a Homeopathic practitioner who suggested I try a natural herbal remedy called Kapex. So being anxious to get off this drug with its long term side effects, of course I did. Well, not only did it work, but also relieved me IMMEDIATELY of another side effect of Celebrex, that I was attributing to something else. NO LONGER DID I WAKE UP WITH THE HORRORS, THE DREADFUL DREAMS, WAKING WITH THE NIGHT SWEATS WITH HEART POUNDING DUE TO SOME HORRIFIC NIGHTMARE!! I was over the moon, how wonderful to get a proper nights sleep without suffering some debilitating horrors of the night! So IS THIS LISTED IN LIST OF SIDE EFFECTS?? NO, OF COURSE NOT! yes obviously, it is a side effect and I have been having these horror nightmares for years, and blamed it on my chronic pain."
"Prescribed 100 mg Celebrex, one capsule, 2x daily. I take one pill in the a.m. and PRN for the night dosage. Some minor irritation to stomach, but it does not outweigh the pain relief from tendentious in ankle as well a severely arthritic knee (post traumatic from serious accident). Prefer the Celebrex over narcotics for pain management. Trying to lose weight as well and learning Celebrex can cause weight gain is problematicâ€¦ but I'm willing to try harder to cut calories and I can now exercise. (Insurance company required a letter of medical necessity from the treating physician before agreeing to cover cost.)"
"SIDE AFFECTS: NAUSIA, PAIN IN ALL JOINTS, LOSS OF MOTION IN ALL LIMBS. SEVERE WEAKNESS. PRESCRIBED BY DR. EVEN WHILE TAKING FUROSEMIDE AND WARFARIN WHICH MAY HAVE LED TO FURTHER PROBLEMS."
"I think it may be causing some irritability, now sure though"
"I was diagnosed with a L4/5 herniation in March 2010. I was put on celebrex (200mg) and flexeril (10mg). I used celebrex for approx 4 months once a day. The flexeril helps to sleep. I use occasionally. I get flare-ups from time to time but celebrex brings it under control again with 2-3 weeks. Get your doctor to give you a 90 day supply then it will be on hand when you need it! Don't take Advil with this med, but if you get a headache, tylenol ok."
"My side effects are a constant runny nose and sore throat, plus I have trouble breathing as a result. I love the pain relief, but I cannot handle taking breathing treatments just to take this medicine. I gained about 7 pounds right away, which is also another side effect. I wish I were still young! Good luck to you all! I took Celebrex 200 mg. 1 x a day. This is a much easier treatment than Ultram or Injections of cortisone."
"I took this drug for 2 years for arthritis pain not realizing that this daily pill had been causing my hands and feet to break out. The dermatologist called it eczema, but it was not. It was acute & horrible skin peeling. My feet felt like I was walking on razor blades and my hands were constantly bloody from fissures. Thank God a very wise and very young allergist suggested I stop taking the Celebrex for just 30 days. Two days later they were healing. By 30 days later, hands and feet were completely healed. This allergic reaction needs to be widely known."
"I had been disabled and suffering for over 5 months with the Bulging disk, pinched nerve Intense pain !!! Insurance will not cover or allow a co pay! nice, yah thanks for the coverage ! Pill was a sample from my attending physicain. One 200mg tablet- once a day relived almost all of my intense pain within 2 hours of taking the pill. After less than 1 week there are no known side effects TBD"
It makes everyday activities easier.
this drug kept my severe pain in check prior to my knee replacements
works well takes away most of the pain
I took Celebrax for just 6 days and I got the worst rash ever and there is no improvement on my condition. Don't do it.
I have been taking Celebrex for 4 years and until I hade knee sugery I had no problems with it.But after surgery I had to take Carafate with it
"I have been on 200mg of Celebrex ,2 pills per day,once in the morning and once at night. I could not believe the difference in my pain level...of course it is still there...but more of a dull pain for the most part. It isn't a cure but if it weren't for this drug I don't think i'd be walking today. I have been on it for approximately 8 years and would highly recommend anyone with fibro/C.F.S. to try it. I have had no adverse effects but make sure I take it with food or milk. Before I tried this I was literally rocking back in forth from the pain...it has been my miracle drug!!"
"I was sick for 3 days after taking this medication, and missed 3 days of work. There are many, and they can be very serious. I wouldn't recommend it. Similar to Vioxx, which I believe they took off the market due to deaths. Had awful headaches and stomach problems. Before you consider it, look up the side effects."
"Celebrex did not work at all, and with all of the horrible side effects, it wasn't worth continuing past one week of no relief."
Used for a month. No discernible effect for me.
Great results for the past 13 years. Allows me to feel good again!
"Does nothing for my fibro-pain. Very hard on sensitive stomachs. They gave it to me even though I had an ulcer because they didn't want to give me anything but Motrin and couldn't because of the ulcer. This is what they push on you when they are afraid to give what you really need for pain. I used it for a few months and got no pain relief. It was just like I had taken nothing, and if it weren't for the stomach upset, I wouldn't have known that I took anything. Tylenol is more effective... save you money. I have had it prescribe for other conditions and it worked for nothing. Expensive"
"I was prescribed this drug for acute back pain after a fall & then continued taking it w/chronic back pain. I found no relief from it at all. They told me it would take a full month before I would start to feel anything, meanwhile that's all they would give me for a fall. Yes, a drug that takes a month to work for an acute injury. DUH! Well, I was in agony & also had stomach upset from it. They gave me Celebrex since I had recently had an ulcer and thought it safer than NSAID's. . Had such bad stomach problems & was switched to oxycontin. Which worked fine. Glad it helps some people, but my back pain.it did not and it's way too expensive."
Not very effective for endometriosis pain
This really helps to manage my chronic pain from Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. Highly recommended. I forget just how well it works until I miss taking it one morning. I remember before noon.
"My knee pain is so bad I can barely walk. Getting up from a sitting position is the worst, and even trying to sit down is awful I need to hold onto something to do either, but taking celebrex has eased the amount of pain I feel by 50%/60%"
"Celebrex---Not good for me... Celebrex, The doctor gave it to me at a few high dose. 200mg twice a day and I don't see that it has helped at all. The Celebrex is very expensive, costly. I usually get samples from the doctors office. I would love if the doctor would discontinue my Rx for it all together. But until then, I will take my meds as prescribed."

"Celebrex I am really happy with the pain relief that Celebrex gives me. I wish there were a generic version, as the cost is quite high. It's worth it, though, for the comfort and decreased inflammation. I had tried ibuprofen, Aleve, Tylenol for Arthritis and others with much less success."

"celebrex effectiveness I was prescribed Celebrex, Vioxx, Naprosen along with occasional doses of Aleve for my Rheumatoid Arthritis. NONE of these meds even TOUCHED my pain for the months that I took it. I couldn't even tell that I was taking anything."

good for headaches not neuropathological pain More and more research is showing that the pain associated with ME/CFS and fibromyalgia is neuropathological in nature. This medication while effective for headaches and the like is not intended to be used to relieve neuropathological pain. Current research shows that neuropathological pain is best addressed with medications such as gabapentin and preglabin. This would be an off-label prescription as members of the public health/behavioral medicine/psychosomatic medicine paradigm are working within the NIH and the FDA to supress drug trials showing their hypothesis about psychogenic pain to be incorrect.

"Absolutely brilliant! I have problems with chronic inflammation, couldn't find a category for it so I placed it under osteoarthritis. The only thing that keeps my iron levels up is antiinflammatories. Was on ibuprofen for a long period but my poor old stomach just couldn't handle it anymore. Started on Celebrex and haven't looked back. No side effects at all, apart from the fact it's working! Joint pain greatly reduced, no stomach problems whatsoever. Occassionally when I run out I can tell because my joints start playing up. One of the biggest costs to the Australian Government in terms of pharmaceuticals, but well worth it."
"Works really well My dr prescribes celebrex for extreme menstrual pain. It works really well, although sometimes I find myself needing to take more of the drug than prescribed."
"This does help to a certain degree Celebrex does help, probabably equal to, or alittle better than Arthrotec.But it takes effect much faster,although it is not as good as Bextra, or Vioxx. Vioxx being the best of all. It is really a shame that the ambulance chasers and greedy,unscrupulous people had to look for something to attack. Again, only those in need of it have suffered for it."
"Helps in control of pain but is not complete. This product works partially but I also take hydrocordone at night. I also take omeprazole. Even with help I am unable to do many tasks such as lifting, pulling and some household tasks."
"Hard on fragile stomachs Another medication that did nothing to ease the pain. However, this one caused me serious digestive problems: stomach aches, sickness, irritation, hearburns, sourness and vomitting. Needless to say that I quitted shortly after...I am still weaker (I can't eat mayo or oil) than before taking this med but it gets better day after day."
"Celebrex compatible with cortisone injections Celebrex, the remaining safe cox-2 inhibitor after the banning of Vioxx and Bextra, is the only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compatible with spinal injection therapy because it does not promote bleeding. It was part of an effective therapy for lumbar disc pain which also included Darvocet. Since Celebrex was started at the same time as the injections, its effectiveness is not known. Since it has no direct competition, Celebrex is too expensive; we are considering whether to continue it or return to Lodine now that the injections have been completed. Lodine at its most effective dosage (500mg) caused nosebleeds, it was tolerated at half that dosage, but effectiveness in in doubt because it and Darvocet without cortisone injections did not stop the pain."

"Bad No, and the label told me so much about the possiblity of being bad for stomach and colon problems. I would rather be in pain the to cause anymore stomach problems."
Good It worked fine for me and no side effects. My doctor took me off the meds because of possible heart problems that could be caused by Celebrex.
celebrex this medication did nothing fir me at all. i don't remember having any side effects.
celebrex this medication did nothing fir me at all. i don't remember having any side effects.
"So glad I stopped before the FDA banned it First of all, it didn't do ANYTHING for me. It was just another way to pump me full of pills AND THEN the FDA says it's bad for you, especially if you have a heart condition (which I have) and could cause heart attacks or strokes! Pfft! Very scary since majority of folks taking it are older and do have some kind of heart thing going on... well, there's them and me. Either way, I'd rather chew on a rusty pipe than take the Celebrex again. :)"
Didn''t work for me...thank goodness This never worked for me....I suffer from chronic pain and muscle inflamation from MS. The best I have found to help with these conditions is Ibuprofen 800mg as needed P.S. the dates above are a guess...I used it for a few months to try it out...
"Not as good as Bextra! I sure wouldn't want to rely on it as my only RA relief, and I don't think it does all that much for my pain in my hands. Thank heavens I'm on Enbrel. It does provide some minor relief, but I wish I had my Bextra back. Can't comment on cost effectiveness as I have good insurance, but I think it's expensive anyway. Side effects-wise, it gives me more stomach aches than Bextra ever did, even though I am on prevacid too."
"Drastic side effects My body swelled and I quit making urine. I was taken off the medication asap, and things returned to normal."
"Very Effective This medication has been very helpful in controlling my inflammation and pain. Unfortunately, after extended periods of use, the dosage has to be increased to stay effective because it seems that my body develops a tolerance to the drug. This year, I had to be taken off Celebrex because I began having problems with excessive fluid retention which ended up causing high blood pressure and more pain in my joints than not taking the medication. I would recommend this medication to anyone, however, because it gave me 5 years of satisfactory results."
No Help at all Celebrex had no noticable effect on my pain and inflammation. It was basically useless.
"pretty good, better than other pain relievers yes it worked, no problems or side effects."
"No magic bullet here I did not find this to be any more useful that a coated Aleve. I was taking 3 per day, where Alev would last at least 12 hours. It was like taking m & m s for pain because my RA flares are way beyond this, sadly."
Allergic to pill One dose and I got the worst headache imaginable. Called the doctor and he told me to stay in bed and stop treatment right away.
May be able to avoid surgery! I left knee started swelling up for no discernabe reason. I mean I never twisted it or fell or had some kind of accident that would cause what the MRI indicated. Which is that I have torn my carteledge on both sides of my left knee according to the interpretation by the radiologist. My orthepedic phycician was skeptical for a number of reasons. First I never had any intence pain which is usually what is ascociated with carteledge tears. Second my symtons at the examination in her office. She felt some instability but not real bad. Third my age 54. Sometimes what looks like a tear is actually wear. So she wanted to see the MRI for herself. In the meantime she gave me 6 celebrex and a precsiption for 30. She went on to say if I was not better after the 6th Celebrex then don't fill the presciption. However I got better very quickly. I had forgotton that my Primary care physcian had given me about 20 celebrex samples earlier. I see her again on 09/13/2006 I will probably fill the script for celebrex and just wait on that orthoscopic knee surgery untill I really need it. Very little side effects. I thought I was a little dizzy at first but that went away. Absolutely no stomach pain. I am going to monitor my blood pressure often though because of what experience so had with the similar drugs Viox and Bextra. Best wishes Jasper91
Great One dose does not work. You must get your blood level up with this drug and then it is great.
"never again turns out I'm allergic to Celebrex, hives and low grade fever"
"How would you sum up your experience? I went off of it at the initial stirrings of heart attack fear even though my rheumatologist said it was a flawed study. Changed to Mex?? Used it 8 months and realized it wasn't doing the job so went back to 400 daily of Celebrex and feel much better. Does it work? Well, this year I've had my third total shoulder repklacement (right shoulder) and am scheduled for a total ankle replacement next week, but yes, I feel it helps. No stopping Arthur, though."

"Side Effects Celebrex causes fluid retention, which I can't think of a single woman who WANTS that! ;) So beware, as this is a bit of info that is usually omitted by doctors."
Not good.... I dont really remember specifics just remember that I did not take it for long and did not like it at all
"Use In Moderation I use Celebrex when I can no longer tolerate the aching joints. Sometimes during the day, at which I usually fall asleep. Other times in the middle of the night when the pain doesn't allow me to get a restful sleep. I will always eat something before taking Celebrex as I have a sensitive stomach."
"Never worked very well I tried Celebrex and found that it did not reduce my pain any better than any of the older NSAIDS. After a while it was less effective and my ankles were swelling. In general, the Cox-2 inhibitors failed me. None of them were very effective pain killers and definitely not worth the money I spent on them. Bextra even gave me hives."
"I had bad side effects and was taken off. I guess my body is so sensitive that I could not tolerate it and insisted to my rheumatologists that I be taken off the drug, even though they seemed to think that it was effectively treating my arthritis. All I knew was that I had gained about 15 pounds in two months on the drug (and I tend to stay within the slim to average weight range) and I felt just awful -- my blood pressure was rising and I clearly had edema. Once off the drug I dropped the water weight and felt much better. This was just one of the drugs I tried (including methotrexate) before I found the right RA drug for me -- which has been Humira for the last two years."
"very satisfactory for Celebrex I am very drug intolerant. Most of the NSAIDs irritate my stomach. I take a daily 100mcg dose of Cytotec to protect my stomach lining. Celebrex is the least irritating of the pain medications, and is very effective for most of my pain issues including episodic very painful vasculitis swellings in my hands. I did not tolerate Vioxx. Celebrex being a sulfonamide does not seem to be a problem, even though I am intolerant of other sulfonamides."
"waste of time the medicine worked well for a very short period of time,and then progressively became less and less effective"
great It worked great for me..but then they took it off the market..grrrr
Celebrex I loved Celebrex. I was diagnosed with arthritis due to Lupus and it helps a lot. It took any the swelling and stiffness.
"Celebrex rocks! I have Negative ANA LSE along with a variety of ""side-car"" rheum. issues. I have tried a variety of NSAIDS. Celebrex is the only one that worked immediately, continues to work and is most effective for my aches, pains and flare-ups. I take it along with Plaquinil and it makes a HUGE difference! I used to ache so badly that I wouldn't want to get up to go to work and now, with the combination of both drugs, I feel amazingly better. at the beginning of the Summer, I ran out of both meds and was in the middle of a gigantic network infrastructure change (I'm the MIS Director for a hospital)and couldn't get to the pharmacy to pick up the refills in time. I went for 4 days w/o the meds and I really started to feel poorly. I recommend NEVER going ""cold-turkey"" on these meds! I ended up in the hospital with a weird auto-immune related problem. Give Celebrex a try! It really makes having Lupus easier! Good luck & God bless:) Michele"

Not effective. It works well for arthtitis but not for discogenic pain with radiculopathy.Side effect profile for me was minimal.
"celebrex helped with pain RA complicated with Lupus has caused cartilage loss in leg and shoulder joints. Since use of Celebrex in 1999, I have much less pain and could even perform a stress test on the treadmill. The knee joints have been replaced, but since I don't walk on my shoulders (as Dr. would relate concerning replacement) I need the medication to just reach above my head."

celebrex did not do anything. Cost a lot of money and I didn't even get high. The biggest waste of money I have spent.
"Is OK for me I have been using celebrex 200mg a day and twice in a flare up. I thoght it didn't make a lot of day to day difference until I ran out of them and had no script.it was 3 days before I got to the Dr's and by then I was in a big flare up,so I won't be short of a script again!I have not had any side effects. update.seemed to stop working so no longer taking it."
drug is worthless did not help at all
"Good for muscle aches I still take this for myalgia, but it has a really specific use for me. I still need zomig for migraines, aleve for headaches and sore throats, and fentanyl for sharp chronic pain, and vicodin for breakthrough pain. But Celebrex is much better than the NSAIDs prescribed for my muscle/joint aches."
was it a placebo i honestly never could tell any differences.
"Celebrex keeps the pain tolerable This is a Cox-2 inhibitor and should be used very cautiously. Bextra raised my blood pressure. I stopped Bextra when the bad news came out about Vioxx and other Cox-2 inhibitors. Then, under dr's supervision, I started taking Celebrex, but never more than every other day (in winter) and less often in warmer months (one dose every 3-6 days). I can tell it's time for another dose when I wake up stiff and achy. It doesn't make the pain vanish but it keeps it within tolerable limits."
It hurt my stomach This med. also hurt my stomach and made me feel sick.

"No GI irritation Celebrex isn't as good for acute pain and inflammation as some much less expensive OTCs, but its the only drug that addresses my arthritis without causing stomach problems. I have developed GERD from a lifetime of pain relievers. Its also safe with my Coumadin (bloodthinner)."

"Was the only game in town and then came the ulcer They took away vioxx, then I started take Celebrex with Tramodol as a booser. It helped, but I developed an ulcer and had to stop using it. Now am on the Fentanyl (Duragesic) patch, which is working pretty well, but I'm sorry that I finally had to go to narcotics for relief. But I ran out of choices."
works well for cramps i take 400 mg celebrex a day before and during my periods. it works well to keep them to a minimum and sometimes they even disappear for several hours. i have had some ear sensitivity to sound (also tinnitis) at certain times which i have found is related to all NSAIDs and I do get from time to time with others such as ibuprofen and aspirin.
"Very good I used Celebrex several years ago along, 1999?, with Zantac but still had occassional problems with my stomach so I went on Vioxx which really worked and it was easier on my stomach. I started to have shortness in breath about a year after and before I had a chance to switch to something else Vioxx was taken of the shelf so I came back to Celebrex and also take Nexium to protect my stomach, it's working fine, my sed rate is in the single figure."
"It helped cure the cause After years of taking different medications such as Imitrex for migraines, it was finally discovered that I had arthritis in the neck which was triggering my frequent headaches and the need to use Imitrex injections as well as Imitrex 100 mgs. Since taking Celebrex, my migraines are better managed and controlled and I no more need to give myself a needle of Imitrex."
"It helps, but I hate it - I hate all drugs It works, but I hate the side effects, which is disturbance in digestion and digestive health. I am sure there are many other side effects that I am not even aware of."
"No relief of RA pain from Celebrex Unfortunately, Celebrex has not relieved the pain I have from Rhuematoid Arthritis."
Great Yes it worked but ony in a small way it did not take all pain away.I did not notice any side effects
"Bloating! Celebrex helped with pain, but severly disrupted my whole intestinal tract!!"
"Celebrex...what a waste In my opinion, the drug company must have been the only one to be helped by this medication...got better pain relief with a plain tylenol! Side effect of heartburn that needed medicating."
"Excellant and extremely effective It definitely works. I stop using it because of the litigation. I have used it for very short periods, such as a day at a time and it has been effective in reducing the pain. I usually use exercise which does reduce the pain and lublicate the joints."
Worked great for me I loved Celebrex. It was one of the few drugs that helped my chronic back pain. Unfortunately it gave me stomach pains after about a year of use and I had to stop taking it. I was taking it with Prevacid but it still ruined my stomach. I miss it!
"excellent results I went from the gut rot nsaids to celebrex and there was no comparison. I took it faithfully 2 x day until the safety bullentin came out then I dropped it to an as needed basis. when I stopped it, I noticed my stomach troubles cleared up and the constant nausea went away."
did not help me at all I had an upset stomach whenever I would take it
"Celebrex replaced Celebrex is not good for your body. We read a book about fish oil being a natural anti inflamatory by Dr Sears. We replaced Celebrex gradually with fish oil. I am now taking 8,000mg of fish oil per day. It is cost effective and my body seems to like it."
celebrex wast of time &money
"Use of Celebrex I believe Celerex has worked for me. It takes time and I didn't feel the difference quickly. One day, I just realized that my leg was not causing me the pain it had been. I do believe the cost is outrageous."
"celebrex Quite simply Celebrex is the only thing I've found that adequately treats my joint pain. Without it I would not be able to work and my life would be a misery. My situation may be slightly different in that my rheumatologist believes I have Sjogren's Syndrome in addition to CFS. (However I recently read that CFS patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of Sjogren's as part of the CFS condition). The cardiovascular and stomach bleeding risk concerns me enormously, so I take 1 tablet only instead of the 2 I started on. This keeps my pain tolerable in summer and good in winter. Nothing else seems to work for me and my rheumatologist seems to think the risk is very small."

"Celebrex Worked great to relieve pain when I was first diagnosed. Easy pill to swallow. Kind of expensive with my health coverage. Due to the long-term possible side-effects and the fact that it was really only masking my pain, I was happy to stop taking it. My doctor gave me a 6-week prescription for steriods where i lowered the dose each week. Because of that, i was able to stop taking Celebrex right away. Haven't needed it since as well as the steriods."
"Couldn't Get Out of Bed w/o Celebrex I began using Celebrex on my surgeon's advice, instead of other NSAID's, after stomach surgery (gastric bypass) in 2000. It works at least as well as they did, better in many cases. The others had seemed to work for a while then lose effectiveness - I'd used at least 6 different NSAID's constantly over the previous 20 yrs. After the scare over Vioxx, Bextra and possibly Celebrex causing deaths, my doctor agreed that the risk was acceptable for me. I would have had significant difficulty managing with anything approaching my usual LIGHT schedule of daily household tasks without it; I'd already done without a few times for diverse reasons. I'm the 49 yr. old homeschooling mom of just one now - a 12 y.o. boy. I tried, unsuccessfully at first, to decrease the dose to just once a day. I now do use it mostly once a day after restarting glucosamine & chondroitin. Weight loss has helped some, heat helps some, walking regularly is hard to manage -- poor discipline on my part mostly. I have a used bike now, and will try again when the weather warms some. Water aerobics helped a little, but is no longer easily accessible. The Celebrex is the BIGGIE for me. Also have other medical issues."
"methotrexate and celebrex I have been diagnosed with RA but have without the Rheumatoid factor. I started out small but am currently taking 25mg Methotrexate weekly and have no noticeable side effects from it except a little nausea the day after taking it. My SED rate decreased with the medication but is still not in the normal range and I still have stiffness and achey joints, especially when sitting for long periods. The pain is less, however and I can now walk and I don't feel so fatigued. To try to further decrease my SED rate and increase my wellness my Dr has prescribed Celebrex to be taken in conjunction with the methotrexate. So far I really don't get any additional relief from taking it."
Celebrex Didn't work at all.
Celebrex Didn't work at all.
this helped I was on celebrex for three years. I ccould move in the morning without too much pain. Now my insurance will not cover so I am back on Ibuprofin. Helps but not near as much. It takes me half the day just to get moving and dressed. Then I am afraid to stop because I won't be able to start moving again.
One more Rx that didn't work Tried but it didn't do anything at all.
"Celebrex I remain on Celebrex, in conjunction with other arthritis medications."
celebrex celebrex caused stomach irritation and mild skin rash problems. Very expensive and not covered by insurance. It did very little for pain.
Good if it weren't for the side-effects... I use this for pain in my fingers and it works well for that. The problem is the side-effects that has prevented me from using it as often as I would like to. If I use for more than two days in a row I get hart pains and I don't feel very well. It takes a few days for it to stop. I can't use it more than twice a week or so.
"celebrex Of all the arthritis medications this one seems to work best, but it upsets my stomach and makes me tired and is very expensive, and insurance does not want to pay for this medication."
"celebrex didn't touch my severe RA When my disease began, it hit me like a ton of bricks and instantly disabled me. I had no insurance or physician and I couldn't move or be moved. My mom's doctor prescribed her Celebrex for me, which I took as well as 24 advil/day. The celebrex did nothing for my ""all-over"" pain."
Celebrex --Seemed to help at the beginning but carried on taking the tablets in the hope that they would eventually make the pain go away.

Celebrex i was on it before and just started back this week. Seemed to help a bit before so I am willing to give it another try.
RA-CELEBREX GOOD PAIN RELIEF....NO EFFECT ON PROGRESSION OF RA
"Great for uterine cramps. I was giving Celebrex after having my IUD inserted. Within a half of an hour, the cramps were down to a manageable level, and by that night, I couldn't feel them at all. I think this is a wonderful medication for feminine pain, especially since I didn't notice any side effects at all."
"Celebrex I started taking Celebrex when I injured my knee at work. I have osteoarthritis in both knees, so the celebrex helped both of them. I worked for the orthopaedic doctors that treated me and since it was a workman's com injury, it was free. I noticed soon after I started it that my Fibromyalgia was much better also. However, when the findings came out about the dangers of Celebrex, I quit taking it on my own. I have never found anything as good even though some people say OTC pain relievers are the same. My job now is not as stressful on my joints, so I manage with Tylenol. I have just learned to live with more pain than I had taking Celebrex."
"No Effect Have herniated disk in lower back (scheduled for surgery) and two other protruding disks - one in middle back and one in neck. Also have widespread joint pain. Not due to arthritis, lupus, lymes...jury is still out on what - fibromyalgia? Not sure yet. Anyway, took Celebrex for about 5 weeks. Did not see any noticeable improvement on back, neck, or joint pain. Did not have any noticeable side effects either. Perhaps it helped...but if it did, it was very subtle and not noticeable...and therefore not worth it. Ibuprofen and naproxen do not touch the pain either. Tylenol is the only OTC that helps...and better than Celebrex."
Celebrex This medication has helped ease the pain in my joints and also helped me to move more easily... it is not a fix-all and I use it very cautiously.
"Celebrex I was prescribed this and advised to take it as and when necessary. I believe that is is less harmful on the stomach than other anti-inflammatories. However, I have never noticed any marked improvement from taking it, so rarely use it now."
"Celebrex Prior to taking Celebrex, I was on Bextra then Vioxx (or reverse). Without Celebrex, I can not tolerate the pain in the morning when I try to get out of bed. I have numerous medical conditions and am on over 30 prescription medications per day. I hope they don't take my Celebrex away!"

"Celebrex Celebrex did nothing for me. I started on bextra and found great relief. Unfortunately it has been taken off the market. Yoga is helpful for pain in my back, but my rheumatologist says I should do aerobic activities along with the yoga. He says it is important to keep the joints moving with aerobic type"
"Celebrex causes stomach ache Celebrex (200mg/day) when used over an extended period (6 months or more) caused persistent stomach ache. I stopped taking it and had to be treated with Nexium (40 mg) once a day for 2 weeks. Now the stomach corrosion and pain are gone but I have no substitute for celebex. I am currently relying on glucoseanine with chondrocthyn and MSM which profides some relief, which may range from 20-80% redused pain. As I also have fibrimyalgia I would appreciate effective recommendations both these problems."
"Celebrex I took Bextra until it was removed from the market. While Celebrex is nice, I felt the Bextra worked better."
"Celebrex and hypertension I was taking a higher than usual dose of celebrex, 200mg 2x a day, usually took about 200 but it didn't do much good.the increase in dose was helping but not a whole lot. However I was on vacation in Wyoming and having a lot of pain, but one night I was up all night with feeling bad just everywhere. I had this weird feeling of doom, as if I might die. Anyway I went to clinic the next morning for a pain killer and they took my blood pressure and it was 220 over 160. The feeling of doom was a precurser to a serious problem if I didn't do something. I stopped Celebrex and started on some diazide and pain medicine and was better. The blood pressure returned to normal in a few weeks. So I think Celebrex is dangerous for some people."
Celebrex This product is not as effective for me as Bextra was.
"I need my Celebrex! I know that Cox 2 Inhibitors have potential cardiac consequences, but every time I try to cut back, I hurt during the day and can't sleep at night."
Worse thing ever I have 3 herniated lumbar disk and DDD. The doctor added Celebrex 200mg twice a day to my daily regiment of meds. The first two days I had no side effects and no pain relief. I thought well it probaly takes a week or so to build up and take effect. Boy was I wrong around the fourth day my pain level was the same and I thought I was going to have to go to the ER due to chest pain and my right arm went numb also. I called my orthopedic surgeon and he told me to immediatly stop the medication and if I didn't notice the chest pain and numbness in my right arm going away within a hour or two to go to the hospital. Overall I think this medication is very usefull giving you don't have to go through the H*ll that I did. I have less side effects from the narcotics that I take daily than Celebrex. I give it a F- as an effective solution for any purpose. And it is so expensive. I would use caution if the doctor wants to prescribe this to you. Make sure you keep a log of every effect/change you feel after taking this medication.
"Celebrex causes heart disease When I was unable to take Solgonal due to unavailibity from the Pharmacutical companies I was put on Dolobid 12.5 once a day, then was switched to Vioxx due to stomach discomfort. Vioxx was discontinued because it was supposed to cause heart disease, so went on Celebrex which also has the same effect on the heart, so am now taking Naproxen as of May 2005, it is working for me somewhat although my R/A is returning since discontinuing Solganol injections."
arthritis&fibromyalgia still looking for better treatment

Allergic Reaction I had a severe neuropathic reaction to this drug. It's on my list of no no's.
Celebrex This was the last NSAID that finally DID IN my stomach. Was AWFUL and the ulcer healed but my stomach was BAD for 6 more years and still is if I eat something I happen to have an acid effect from. NEVER would I recommend an NSAID for long term use for ANYone!
Celebrex I am using this medicine for almost 9 months. Best thing about it is that almost no side effects. It works very good in long term use as it did for me. For worse pain i have to take some other medicine but in mild pain it works very well.
celebrex effect at first but after a while didn't work and I had stomache problems. Quit using before scare.
Celebrex Taking this twice a day really helps wih my pain. I have decreased to once a day and quickly noticed a difference so I know it helps with my pain when I take it BID. I feel this product is very effective and safe to use.
Celebrex I find Celebrex more helpful for my osteoarthritis than Fibromyalgia.

Celebrex Yes you can use it.
Made me sick This made me sick to my stomach and gave me no relief that I'm aware of.
Celebrex pretty effective for me I have had to briefly discontinue celebrex because of bleeding ulcer. I REALLY missed it for the 4 weeks it took to heal my stomach. Suggest that it always be taken with food.
"Celebrex Not as good as Bextra, by far, in my opinion."
"Lasted half as long as Opiates, but it worked Reduction in pain was marginal, but effective for an hour to 2 hours."
"Lasted half as long as Opiates, but it worked Reduction in pain was marginal, but effective for an hour to 2 hours."
Good but expensive I tried Celebrex for about 6 months. It was somewhat effective but very expensive. I found something less expensive and almost as effective.
"Celebrex I was on celebrex until my insurance would not pay for it any longer, which was about 2 years, then was put on vioxx and was on it about 2 years, until I had a light heart attack and they took me off vioxx. I was not in as much pain when taking the drugs, but now know it was not good for my health and also caused me more problems."

allergic reaction I can blame thid allergic reaction to this medcation on my doctor and pharmacy because they all know I am allergic to sulfa.
"Celebrex If Celebrex didn't cause heart issues, I would be on it right now. It actually works better than any of the others I have tried and my husband refuses to quit taking them because it would so diminish his quality of life from constant pain."

Celebrex Good but doctor took me off as some trouble with safety
"effect negligible Tried it some years ago, when it just came out."
"celebrex rating I like the celebrex but discontinued it because of problems w/stomache bleeding. The cost can be a bit daunting, as well."
celebrex This drug worked great the first 2 weeks then nothing. Then I started noticing that my heart would race and I would jolt out of a sound sleep with my heart racing. That was before all the warnings. It was about 2 years ago when all my doctors were pushing it. Everyone walking out of the door had a Celebrex sample. Funny...I dont see that anymore...hmmm
"Celebrex and longtime usage I have been on Celebrex since it's inception to the world of ""miracle"" drugs. A cox-2 inhibitor but still causes a lot of gastrointestional problems. I have to take nexium and carafate daily along w/the celebrex. I have had 3 episodes of ulcers prior to using the nexium and carafate as a prophylactic. Now I just take both everyday and for the past year, no episodes of ulcers. Before a few major operations, I was told to stop taking the celebrex for a few days prior the surgery. It was only then that I realized how much the celebrex did help. I also have some major osteoarthritis and boy did that ever flare-up without using the celebrex. I've learned through the years that when you are going through a major fibro flare-up, NOTHING helps."

Now I just take both everyday and for the past year, no episodes of ulcers. Before a few major operations, I was told to stop taking the celebrex for a few days prior the surgery. It was only then that I realized how much the celebrex did help. I also have some major osteoarthritis and boy did that ever flare-up without using the celebrex. I've learned through the years that when you are going through a major fibro flare-up, NOTHING helps."

Celebrex This has been very effective for me.
"Celebrex (Celecoxib) I've been taking Celebrex for four years and it does help with the inflammation of arthritis. It does not take away all the pain but does help enough to keep me mobile. I get to thinking it's not helping and cut back the dose, cutting it in half and within a week the arthritis pain was more than I could tolerate and the stiffness in my back and hands was making me unable to carry on my daily activities. I have not had any problems with side effects taking this drug. I find the cost to be outrageous and ridiculous. I would not take this drug because of the high cost if I could take any of the other anti-inflammatory drugs because they work just as well."
Not much difference Celebrex didn't make any difference in my back pain.
"Celebrex - does the job for me For me it is a teriffic medicine to knock down the arthritis back pain just enough to allow my other pain meds to really do a better job. I've tried other otc meds to no avail and other perscription meds and also not a lot of help, but Celebrex does the job for me."

Rate Remedy: Celebrex (Celecoxib) Celebrex I found is not effective for either backache or other arthritic pains
Celebrex Had no relief at all.
celebrex I found Celebrex to be helpful.
"Celebrex Celebrex had no effect on my pain what so ever. I think I have tried every n-said on the market and nothing helped. I had been on anti-inflammatory drugs for over ten years when A disc collapsed in my neck. After a cage fusion repair I have permenant nerve damage in both hands. Hey it's better than being a quadraplegic though. I suppose. I am now dealing with 6 more bulging low back disc, one herniated with a tear. I have osteoarthritis in all my joints and fibromyalgia & Chronic fatigue. I see a therapist and a physciatrist monthly and often wonder why me? I don't want sympathy, I want answers. My neurosurgeon said I have my C-7 T-1 fused at birth or congentialy blocked. Perhaps this is just my lot in life. I wish you all wellness and hope you find the answers you are looking for. Thanks for being here for me. Blessings are wishes delivered by the angels of hope. You got to believe for it to be true. Does anyone know what a Schmmorl Node is?"
"NSAIDS DO NOT HELP TENDER POINTS NSAIDS cause more harm to kidneys than do opioid drugs and if you have ever been in treatment for recreational cocaine use, it is highly unlikely you will get the meds you need, even though cocaine and opiates act on different parts of the brain. I do not know where these doctors got their training. It is quite sad that one who suffers from pain cannot get the tratment he/she deserves, so I stay away from pain doctors and just go to a chiropractor and have my shrink prescribe ultram and soma, which are not controlled drugs, and I feel o.k. most of the time, but I am only 35 and the pain will get worse with age, so I probably will need narcotic pain meds in the future. Celebrex did nothing for me."
"Victoria Gunther - Celebrex Found Celebrex is very helpful for me. As yet have had no side effects and have been on it for a number of months. I tried voltaren, surgam, naprosyn etc. But found celebrex very helpful."
celebrex I've been taking celebrex for 7 yrs since cracking my hip.find it helpful.
Celebrex Not as effective as Vioxx
"Celebrex was like taking nothing at all for me. I'm not sure why. I have disk pain from accidents (annular tear, bulge and herniation on various disks), and have also been diagnosed with post-traumatic fibromyalgia. I've also got a bunch of osteoarthritic changes like we all get, so I was given Celebrex to try. It was as if I was taking nothing at all. I felt literally nothing change from taking it. So, onward to try other things. I'm now on a program of duragesic patches with morphine and lidocaine for breakthrough pain. I get around in an electric wheelchair. It's not perfect, but it makes things reasonably bearable."

"Rate Remedy: Celebrex I have always had pain in my lower back which I've always blamed on childbirth. I later progressed to a bulging disk at C-5 which they diagnose me with now as ""degenerative disk disease"" of arthritis. I had a car wreck 3 years ago and crushed L-3. My orthopaedic surgeon performed a kyphoplasty procedure, in case no one has heard of it, it's where they go in by guided x-ray and have 2 small tubes on both sides of the vertebrae and inject what I called ""concrete"" to fill and bring the area back to where it is supposed to be. I don't know that it has been a cure all because I already had back pain and can't tell that it's any better although sometimes I do think it's worse. I have been on Celebrex for my back for the past 3 months and although I don't realize that it's helped, I do notice if I miss taking it once a day as prescribed."

"Celebrex usage I started Celebrex after being on Piroxicam for about 10 years. My family doctor thought it would be more effective for some increasing pain and that I would have less chance of GI side effects in the future. After trying it for several months, I thought it was ok, but it did not give me the pain relief I had had on the Piroxicam. I had the occasional GI acid reflux problem, but no more or less than while on Piroxicam. So, after Vioxx and Bextra were removed from the market, I switched back to Piroxicam. I take it with Effexor XR, which is supposed to increase it's effect. It seems to do so for me."
"Osteoarthritis is a pain -- and so are the remedie After experiencing an increase in acid reflux discomfort on the etodolac I had been taking successfully for several years, my rheumatologist put me on CellCox 200 -- the Israeli version of Celebrex. Having had earlier unfortunate experiences with Vioxx, I soon looked up celecoxib/Celebrex on the internet to find that strong doubts had recently been raised re: heart problems. Can't remember whether I started experiencing chest twinges before or after I read these reports, but I took myself off the drug before I completed the first month's dosage. I was additionally concerned that I had been put on double the dosage recommended in the directives accompanying the medicine and those found in internet articles. My rheumatologist would have taken me of the drug on my next visit, in reaction to the adverse information that was increasingly available."
"Celebrex Neck, spinal, and hand osteoarthritis I found this of almost no value in preventing pain and discomfort."
"Celebrex Neck, spinal, and hand osteoarthritis I found this of almost no value in preventing pain and discomfort."
"Celebrex For me, Celebrex works. I am on the minimum dosage and don't have any heart problems, but my doctor keeps a close watch on me anyway. As far as cost-effectiveness goes, I have no insurance but the the pharmaceutical company that makes celebrex sends it to my doctor free. I have had degenerative disk disease for about 10 years. In 2002 I had surgery on my neck to attach a plate and fuse 2 of the cervical disks. I have another disk in my lower back that gives me trouble, but Celebrex helps with that. I also have a pinched nerve in my shoulder which causes extreme pain, but Celebrex helps with that also. The pain is not nearly as bad as it was, thanks to Celebrex."

"Try something else, first I found Celebrex to be very ineffective. Long term use caused major stomach problems and the cost, even with my insurance, was extremely high. Would recommend something less expensive, such as Naproxen, as being more effective with fewer side effects."
CELEBREX I HAVE RECENTY RETURNED TO CELEBREX AFTER MY CONCERN WITH HEART ATTACKS AND STROKE. NOW THAT I AM ON A LOW DOSE ONLY ONCE A DAY I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN I FELT WHEN ON TYLENOL ARTHRITIS PAIN.
"I Miss Vioxx!! I switched to Celebrex after the FDA pulled Vioxx from the market thinking it would be pretty much the same, but it's not. I have bad, bad tendonitis/pain in my knees from playing competative tennis from the time i was 10, for hours everyday - it was my life, but also ruined my knees. Vioxx worked much better for me, both of them are very expensive though. :>)"
CELEBREX-The Great Anti-flammatory Drug! I have to say that this drug is absolutely wonderful! I went to a seminar for Avonex with David Lander. There was a Doctor who mentioned that a patient of his had arthritis and that the Celebrex helped him with the side effects. I mentioned it to my Neurologist and he went ahead and prescribed it for me. WONDERFUL RESULTS! I highly recommend you folks to try it! Good Luck! **This is great for the interferons!**
Celebrex and Fibromyalgia I like vioxx better.
"Celebrex 100mg I was prescribed Celebrex after being taken off Vioxx (recalled); It seems all the cox-2 enzyme meds work the same. It just depends on how mobile you are able to be in regard to your pain. Pro-activity is key; now I'm back to naproxen or ibuprofen for maintenance of my pain. Stronger pain killers aren't an option;until something is developed for the specifics of degenerative back disease and/or osteoarthritis, we're on our own. Just try to keep moving!"
DID NOT HELP ME THE HORRIBLE STOMACH PAINS AFTER 3 DAYS CONVINCED ME IT WAS NOT THE DRUG THAT I WANTED TO PUT IN MY SYSTEM SO I CAN'T SAY IT EVER HELPED

Celebrex I have Lupus (1998)and newly diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.Celebrex seemed to have lost effectiveness after 12 mos. I got off it in 1999. Now with the scare of heart attacks and strokes I don't think I'll go back as an alternative drug therapy.

"Celebrex Tried this for a few months but did not like the feelings it engendered in me. I was 'afraid' of it, and took myself off the med. with Dr's permission. Also tried Vioxx with similar results. Now on Plaquenil 200m.g.per day, but dislike side effects-e.g. my eyesight is bothering me and hearing affected. May get taken off this, but will wait till end of month to see how I feel by then. Would like to try being without medication altogether; have also heard about Celadrin, [has fatty acids and cox 2 inhibitor]; maybe less side effects with this. Anyone else tried it?"
"Celebrex used celebrex for about 6 months dx with 2 herniated disks and arthritis in lower back... did not help for any of my pain... then again, nothing has helped for my back pain so far... still waiting for something to come along... positive: encountered no side effects"

Celebrex I felt nothing.
YES IT DID HELP I'D MARK THIS ONE UP AS A KEEPER. YES IT HELPS WITH THE 24/7 HEADACHES BUT NOT FOR THE STRONG #10'S. (FEMALES ITS GREAT FOR CRAMPS TOO). SIDE EFFECTS ARE CONSTIPATION ! LONG TERM USE AFTER MORE THAN 14 DAYS I’D GET A REBOUND HEADACHE AND WOULD RESIDE TO ANOTHER FORM OF RELIEF. THUMBS UP ON THIS ONE !!!
"Horrible Side Effect After just one dose of this medication, I had the most severe abdominal pain and cramps I have ever had. I stopped it immediately."
"celebrex My doctor put me on celebrex after I had begun to have stomach problems with all the other nsaids; he told me to take it particularly at night, since one of the worst of the FM effects is inability to stay sleeping. It does work, but I get some GI effects (constipation/gas) and if I take it during the day, headaches. Since it lasts for 12 hours at a time though, it is more effective than the shorter acting drugs at night. I also take gabapentin twice a day."
"Celebrex I used Celebrex when I had severe pain when my long thoracic nerve was paralysed. At the height of the pain it was effective. However, after about a month the side effects kicked in and I ended up really ill !! I didn't find it effective with the Fibromyalgia pain and I wouldn't take it long term. If needed I may be persuaded to take it in a crisis situation. I am sure that others have had better experiences but I have found that with fibro, I am super sensitive to many drugs and have to rely on building up my immune system to conteract viruses etc.!"
This drug was useless This medication did nothing but dent my wallet.
"Celebrex (Celecoxib) I have been using Celebrex for the past 5 years. I suffer from Mixed Connective Tissue Disease and Fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed with these 10 years ago. I have been taking 200mg. twice a day and have had no problems with the drug. I've tried about every drug out there for pain relief, including opiates, but my stomach can't handle most of these anymore. Celebrex doesn't bother me, so I plan to continue using it. Recently, I started taking Cymbalta and my pain has diminshed. I am now dropping my nightly dose of Celebrex in favor of the Cymbalta (60mg). I hope this combination will continue to work. I'm not completely pain-free, but I feel much better. One other problem with Celebrex is that my insurance will no longer cover it. I have had to fax my prescription to a Canadian pharmacy in order to receive a ""discount."" I now pay $150 a month for this prescription! I've checked around here and the same amount would cost me $190/month, so I save some money by ""going to Canada."""
Rating Celebrex I have taken this drug for a number of years now and find it to be very effective. When I first started taking it I blessed it as a wonder drug. I could get out of bed and dress myself without help. It gave me back my independence and only someone who has been there can appreciate what it is to get that back. The only draw back for me to this medication is it's cost.

"celebrex to help inflammation all down for thoraci I have been suffering from back/neck pain for 6 years now. From one point to another. During this period, ibuprofen never worked for me. My discs have degenerated (partially as a result of over-conservative treatment by my neurosurgeon, who is however good as a surgeon), and an osteopath associated with my neurosurgeon. 4 months ago I started using celebrex, after a 2-level disc replacement, and osteopathy which worsened my thoracic pain condition. I also stopped it for a few days, and found that I needed it. I have such high levels of pain, and disability, that I literally bend over with the pain if I stop either celebrex, or the use of tramadol and diazepam, having a lot of muscular seizures. Some of the side-effects of celebrex counteract the side-effects of tramadol (namely the diarrhea and constipation, and constipation gives me trouble at my lower spine, which has had 3-level dynesis done on it. I am hoping to get further help with therapies to sort the thoracic discs out, but have to say that celebrex has really helped me. In addition, I was having heart fluctuations as a result of anxiety disorder. With the help of a good psychiatrist, the anxiety disorder is under control (before I started taking celebrex), and even while taking a dosage of 600mg a day (at the moment) of celebrex, I have had no heart fluctuation problems, except those that occur under certain phobic conditions, while in pain (such as getting an email from one's neurosurgeon's wife, warning one from hitting on her hubby !!!). Therefore, I strongly recommend it, and am able to work on the exercises etc with relatively little time. I do wish there was a slow release one capsule a day one though ! The following sites may be useful. I found them so.

"Celebrex- Heartbreaker? I was diagnosed with RA in 1999. My Rheumatologist started me on Celebrex and Methotrexate right away. I'd been taking Celebrex for 5 years when the insurance company decided they didn't want to pay anymore (as it was, my copay was over $200 for a 3 month supply). Celebrex helped a lot. Virtually, no side effects. Inflamation was periodic, pain was not as intense, and less frequent. Until the recent news concerning viox and other nsaids, I didn't think the HEARTATTACK I had had anything to do with the drugs I was on! I was 43 when I had it, and had been on Celebrex for 4 years. Now I have a cardiologist, a stent, and more pills to take. It will be interesting to see how this all pans out."
Celebrex Celebrex seems to help a little bit but not very much. This was the first drug that my doctor prescribed for me.
"Mary Delano Think Celebrex helped my chronic arthritic pain quite well, however doctor recommended change due to possible loss of effectiveness after long-term use. Had no ill side effects and after recent switch to Mobic, dramatic increase in need for pain meds. Discussing options with both RA and Spinal doctors."

"For Migraines...No Way I was prescribed this for migraines after nothing else worked and I had absolutely no side effects, which is really good, but I also had no results."
Not worth the money For the cost of using celebrex vs anything else. I was better off using something else.I couldn't tell that it made any difference in my pain.
Celebrex I have been on it for a few years now and until about 2 years ago it worked very well. I used it more on a needs basis. Now I take it twice every day and it doesn't seem to be doing much but the pain is so bad I am reluctant to stop it.
"Celebrex vs. Aleve For me Celebrex has been an occasional substitute for Aleve, taken to deal with muscle tension and joint stiffness. Of the two, Aleve or its generic equivalent, Naproxen Sodium, worked best. Celebrex is acceptable but doesn't seem to help the lightheadedness as the Aleve does."
"Celebrex Worked very effectively for me, only my insurance won't cover it and it's too expensive to pay out of pocket."
Celebrex causes stomach ache After using celebrex (20mg/day) I found it to cause persistent stomach ache. My GP asked me to stop taking it and treated the condition with Nexium (40 mg) once a day for 2 weeks. Now the stomach corrosion and pain are gone but I have no substitute for celebex as Vioxx is not prescribed any more. Would appreciate recommendations on a suitable substitute fot my osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia pains.
Celebrex and other NSAID's I have fibromyalgia/myofascial syndromes. These do not usually work on people with these disorders and they cause very bad gastric reactions. I get so angry when doctors treat these illnesses like arthritis. IT ISN'T THE SAME!!!!!!!! I know that you've got to give medicines a few days and sometimes the side effects go away or at least are tolerable. I had bad gastrointestinal reactions to it. Never again will I take it.
couldn't tolerate it All NSAIDS give me diarrhea.
couldn't tolerate it All NSAIDS give me diarrhea.
"Celebrex This was a medication that was a no-goer for me. I gave it a fair test period, and found out that I had less pain with what I'd been taking: Ultram and Excedrin."
"dangerous Celebrex masked the pain well enough to hide the fact that it was giving me gastritis. One evening, with no warning, my stomach swelled to about the 8-month pregnancy level. An hour later I was rushed to the E.R. with acute esophogeal spasm. This was unbelievably painful, scary, and debilitating. Stay away from it!"
No positive effect... I might have been taking a sugar pill.
Celebrex and side effects Celebrex gave me side effects of headache and stomach upset and the effectiveness was minimum in comparison to the side effects and therefore I had to discontinue the medication.
"Celebrex I only received a small amount of pain relief for IC with this medication. I can say it helped a little more than Ibuprofen, but not much. This is expensive medication. When this medication was not effective for pain relief, my phsycian added a narcotic pain medication with it. I do not believe that this Celebrex actually helped me much."
"No effect Absolutely no effect, though no side effects either."
"Celebrex Very little effect,even after continued one month use"
"No effect This had absolutely no effect on my pain levels. No side effects either, though."
Useless AND expensive More dollar aspirin substitutes shoved down my throat by doctors too paranoid to give me something that works. Helpful only to the drug company that makes it.
"celebrex i have a bad case of rheumatoid arthritis in every joint of my body. relefan, celebrex did not do a thing for me. steroids, presidone is the only thing i can take and be able to move."
celebrex I notice only very slight easing of the pain
celebrex was helping for the first few months but hasn't been helping at all lately...
Celebrex=Kidney Damage NSAID's can cause kidney damage. Long term use can cause other damage we aren't aware of. I got little relief from pain with this drug and didn't know about the side effects until years after it was first prescribed. Luckily I don't take it as prescribed or I might be a lupus patient with kidney damage. very scary.
"Celebrex helped When my RA was more active, I decided Celebrex wasn't helping me because I still had quite a bit of pain. I stopped taking it, and realized two days later that it helped A LOT. It didn't take away the pain, but it really dulled it. My activity level for the day determines whether I will take 1 or 2 that day. I've had no side effects."
No effect at all Unfortunately I had no relief from OA from Celebrex (which was a great pity as I got it for free!)
Celebrex I had constant sciatic pain for about 6 months. I tried stretching and other physical therapies and had decided to just live with it. Viox provided no relief. Ibuprofen would work for short periods. Aspirin was of no benefit. My physician prescribed Celebrex and I have been virtually pain free for several months. I tried to stop using it to see if the sciatic pain had simply gone away. Within several days I was in pain again. I think this is a great drug and it gave me back my activity level. I do find myself concerned with side effects--although I have noticed absolutely none. I wonder about kidney damage??
Celebrex Celebrex was helpful for joint pain but did absolutely nothing for my headaches.
Celebrex I have had good results with Celebrex.
Celebrex 100 mg I didn't find Celebrex 100 mg useful at all for my cervical spine pain problems compared to 50mg of Vioxx.
Celebrex Was diagnosed w/OA in rt. knee. Took Celebrex going on 4 wks. Pain was bad and worsened over period. Couldn't sleep. Started taking Alleve (1 every 12 hrs.) w/Celebrex. Pain decreased.
"Worked for a while I was prescribed Celebrex for a double reason - firstly to get past bouts of sciatica (short term solution to control inflammation and pain), and secondly to reduce the amount of bleeding to help with the pain of endometriosis and adenomyosis. The first couple of months it worked relatively well, when taken in combination with physiotherapy, to reduce the inflammation and pain associated both with sciatica and adenomyosis/endometriosis. The dosage I was on was 2-3 per day for 2 weeks starting a week before a period. They stopped supressing any pain around the third month. These days I am unable to take any anti-inflammatory medication as they damage the kidneys, and I have fairly advanced kidney disease."
"The best relief I get from OA pain & inflammation I used to require large doses of ibuprofen to control pain and inflammation, but had to stop when I developed stomach problems. Since then, I've been on Celebrex, which has helped more, at lower and fewer doses, with fewer side effects than the ibuprofen. I originally started at 100 mgs. once a day, as needed, and have gradually increased, first to 200 mgs. once a day, every day, then to twice a day, and I've been on that dose without needing any additional anti-inflammatories for over 2 years. The only real issue I have with it is the cost, which is unbelievably high, even with insurance. It is the single most expensive med I take, with 100 days' supply costing me $160 in CO-PAYS! The last time I had it filled, it cost more than all my other name-brand meds combined."

Celebrex I have found Celebrex to be the best treatment for OA pain that I've tried. Unfortunately I no longer have insurance and have to pick and choose which meds I can afford. I have been off of this for a month now and I have horrible joint pain.
"Too costly... Sore back? This is a good drug, as is ibuprofen. Herniated disk? This is only a good option as a maintenance drug, taken every day, to prevent or lessen acute pain recurrences. During an acute increase in pain, this drug is useless. This drug is ridiculously priced at $100.00+ per month."
Celebrex This is the first med I've used for osteoarthritis. It has worked well so far.
"Celebrex Worked wonders for my knee , A+ relief I was on it from day 1 of being released on the market. DID ABSOLUTLY NOTHING FOR MY CHRONIC NECK PAIN. Pulled off of it due to total failure. No NSAIDS worked to even touch the severe pain. I had a herniated C4-5, with bone splinters on C6 ACDF surgery preformed 11/03... not much of a success yet, but I have the best neurosurgeon in Md who did the work, and more work may need to be done soon due to other symptoms. Celebrex works great for knees, hips but I personally would rate it very low for c-spine pain that was chronic and still is.

"Didn't help much, Insurance wouldn't approve This didn't help that much, and my insurance wouldn't approve it anyway, so I wasn't able to continue past the time that my doctor gave me samples for."
"Not too good for me. I only took it for about a week. My doctor had prescribed it for Lupus/Rheumatoid artrhitis. It didn't help the pain much at all, and after a few days, I had the worst stomach pains-I almost called an ambulance! Now, I only take it when I can't stand the pain in my hip and shoulder, and only for one or two days-any more than that, and my stomach starts hurting too bad to take it anymore."

"Celebrex I was given samples from my doctor to try and I did for a little while. However, it made me feel very sick on my stomach each time I took it. Therefore, I stopped taking it."
"Reduced blood flow This medication was similar to Naprosyn in that it reduced the blood flow and indirectly reduced the pain. However, as it was found that I had kidney disease, I can no longer have anti-inflammatory medications of any kind."
"CELEBREX I am a 55 yr old male with severe osteoarthritis of spine and shoulders. I went on Celebrex as soon as it came out. I described it at the time as a miracle drug. My morning pain and stiffness were essentially gone after a couple weeks on the drug. After several years, it does not seem to be working as well, possibly because my arthritis has progressed to where I have virtually no disk spaces, have spinal and foramenal stenosis resulting in pain, tingling and numbness of legs and feet. Just too much for Celebrex to handle I think. But for a few years it was GREAT!!! It did what no other drug could, WITHOUT side-effects. Funny, I tried the other two Cox-2 Inhibitors - Bextra and Vioxx - and neither one worked for me. I suspect it has something to do with how an individual's unique metabolism breaks down the drug into non-therapeutic components. Anyways, I am now trying Mobic. Only been two days, so I can't comment. Hope it works. Otherwise I'll be having an epidural. And if that doesn't work - I hate to think about it - surgery. I have the spine of an 85 year-old man. I don't know what happened. The rest of me is aging pretty well, just the %$%#&###^& SPINE!!"

"Ah-h-h relief Celebrex has really helped with my Fibro pain. Occasionally, I find I have to discontinue it for a week or so, and the relief it gives comes back. Every othr pain med. totally uppset my stomach. Celebrex does not. It has been a real help to me."
celebrex Celebrex helped with swelling and joints worked better. It eased pain - not a lot but it helped. The problem I had was it made my skin bruise and cut easily.
"Celebrex Stopped working after a while, had to change to another medication."
Celebrex Better than average NSAID with few side effects.
Celebrex short term Used it for about a month before I switched to Bextra that worked better for me.
"Celebrex The effect of Celebrex is very much limited, it only lasts a couple of hours."
"celebrex Celebrex isn't all that strong for me, but does take the edge of somewhat."
"Celebrex I've been taking celebrex for over 3 years..without it.. my body and joints hurt badly.. if I go a few days without it, I can really feel the difference.. I wouldn't give up this med for anything .. it helps keep me going."
"Celebrex It seems everything works for a while. Celebrex and Vioxx both helped greatly at first but after a while the cost/benefit ratio just didn't make sense. I have been using my own concoction of 2 acetaminophen and 2 350mg aspirin once a day with a possiblity of a kicker at night of either the asprin or the acetaminophen. It, too helps but for how long I just don't know yet. It is considerably cheaper."
"celebrex helped with pain RA complicated with Lupus has caused cartilage loss in leg and shoulder joints. Since use of Celebrex in 1999, I have much less pain and could even perform a stress test on the treadmill. The knee joints have been replaced, but since I don't walk on my shoulders (as Dr. would relate concerning replacement) I need the medication to just reach above my head."
"Celebrex My sister, who is 52, woke up one morning, 3 months ago, and her left arm and left leg were very weak. She thought she had slept wrong. I told her to go to hospital. She did and they said she had a stroke. Was in hospital for a week. The Celebrex was immediately discontinued and we sensed they thought it could have caused it. That was the only med she was on except for a low dose blood pressure pill. She is still not back to work."
Arthritis After extensive gardening activity and bowling my knee stiffens and is painful. After two days of taking Celebrex I'm much better.
"Celebrex I've been taking Celebrex almost constantly for about four years. When I took the first dosage, I thought it helped the pain (except for the pain in my feet, for some reason) quite a lot. The more I took it, the more it quit helping. Now it helps, but not to a big degree. If I miss taking it, I can tell the difference, though...the stiffness, pain, & immobility increase; so I really don't like to miss a dose. I try to only take it once a day, but I have it prescribed for twice daily, & when I feel that I absolutely have to take it again, I do so. I haven't really had any problems with side effects, that I know of. Back before my hysterectomy, I did have much heavier periods, but I'm not sure if it was caused by the Celebrex or not. (sorry for probably giving too much info there, but if it can help someone else, I will do it :) I will usually take my 1st Celebrex in the early AM, about an hour before I need to try to get up; & that seems to help ease the pain & stiffness of getting up out of bed, etc. I will also take one during the evening if I'm having a particularly bad day; sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't seem to."
"Celebrex Did Not Work Celebrex never gave me any FMS pain relief, but it did take the edge off my osteoarthritis pain. I can no longer afford to take it because I am on SSDI. They do not offer a free or low cost med program for Celebrex."
Skip it... Celebrex caused constant stomach burning and provided little or no pain relief.
"Celebrex My former rheumy owned stock in the parent company. Unfortunately, Celebrex was very, very hard on my stomach and gave little pain relief."
Celebrex It works good but does not last long enough. It is also very expensive to buy.
"Celebrex I did not get anything from this medicine. I did try it for a few weeks and noticed nothing different about my pain, stiffness, and or anything else. I have been finding with FMS/CFS there are almost no treatments that have been successfull. I hope I find something soon as I have no pain managment, after 1+ yrs of diagnosis and a lifetime of problems and pain, because of complicated Gastritis."
Somewhat Effective Celebrex is somewhat effective for pain but don't expect miracles like the commercial where people are dancing around and playing sports. After taking it for awhile it becomes ineffective and does nothing but cause stomach discomfort.
CELEBREX DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP WITH THE PAIN
No Way Taking for RA & OA. Constant naseua. Didn't help pain. But then most of my pain is from the RA and Celebrex is not really effective for that. Too expensive.

major diappointment This stuff did nothing but make me irritable & nauseated.
costly drug 6 months no change went on to Mobic next which after several months was not effective currently on bextra will be increasing 20mg to 40 if doc accepts my request
"Celebrex Took for about 3 months, it wasn't any more effective than naproxen but it caused my feet and legs to swell real bad. I will not take it again."
"celebrex didnt make me dance I found no pain relief at all from Celebrex, it was just money down the toilet. Interesting to note how some people had very good results, and others (like me) found no benefit at all. What a strange condition FMS is....."
celebrex for fibromyalgia I have suffered with fibromyalgia for 13 yrs. I did not know what it was until the last 4yrs. I was at the chiropractor at least once a week and in tears most of the time. I didn't know what it felt like to not hurt. My doctor prescribed Celebrex for me and my whole life turned around. For the first time since I could remember I didn't hurt!!!! It is the best drug I have ever taken and would recommend it to anyone who suffers from fibromyalgia.
"Celebrex 200 mg 2xday I have been taking Celebrex for about a year and a half. Celebrex helps with the swelling of my hands and helps me ward off migraine headaches. It's a $40 copay with my health insurance for a one month's supply. If you don't have health insurance the outright cost of this medicine is approximately $200 for 200 mg 2xday, which is the largest strength this medicine can be taken at. It's worth the $40 a month for me with the help that it gives me. If I feel a migraine coming on, I immediately take a Celebrex and ward it off. Also, I take it in the morning and then take my shower and by the time I'm dressed and ready to work, I can because the swelling in my hands is gone. You have to take it on a regular basis for it to continue to help you. As soon as I forget a pill, the swelling returns!"
celebrex Was not very effective. Expensive
"Celebrex for Pain Relief I was taking Celebrex for several years for OA in the knees, shoulders, and now the hands, and also for degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia. After taking Celebrex and Naproxin, I've found Vioxx to be gentler on my stomache while giving me the same benefits as these other medications. Celebrex tended to upset my stomache. And as with all other NSAIDs I've taken, Celebrex did not reduce nor aleviate my pain: it only temporarily reduced swelling in the effected areas. Shots were still needed roughly every 8 to 10 weeks whether on an NSAID or not, and swelling reduction lasts only as long."

"Too much itching! Initially, I had fair results, till the itching started. Never really helped with the inflammation and swollen hot joints. This was prior to dx with RA - was treated for OA only. Not real good for me -allergic to sulpha drugs, and had bad reactions."
Outrageous price... I have been taking Celebrex for a couple of years. Recently my insurance company wouldn't renew my prescription until the doctor filled out a bunch of BS extra paperwork that is required because it is so expensive. The communication between my RD and the insurance company took nearly a month so I ran out of Celebrex and was nearly three weeks without it. I went into a major flare with the pain doubling daily. That experience taught me two things...Celebrex is doing me some good and I better not run out again. Insurance companies should not have the right to refuse to send meds when they are given a prescription from a doctor. That is pure BS. Especially as it is too expensive for me to pay for out of pocket.
celebrex I don't find it to be effective
Celebrex I took Celebrex for about 5 months. I was up to 3 200mg. doses per day. I stopped taking it and started taking Motrin IB. I feel alot better. I take Motrin 400 mgs 3 times a day. Celebrex did very little to help me.
"celebrex This was a wonder drug for me, but it drove my liver enzymes up so high my doctor took me off of it."
Celebrex & OA I took Celebrex in hopes of easing the pain of OA- I was indeed disappointed. It did nothing for me. I waited it out for several months and I never got relief. I had heard good things about celebrex too. It just didn't work for me. Peace & Joy~
Not very helpful I feel Celebrex is not much better than Motrin or other over the counter NSAID drugs except that it does not effect the GI tract which could lead to bleeding. I just found about a new drug Bextra which is rated higher by users but seems to have some bad side effects
"Celebrex Like all NSAIDS and COX-2 inhibitors, the fatigue I experience as a side effect from those drugs are not worth it. The pain from spinal OA is gone, but I found I was too tired to get up in the morning!"
migraines have found no relief with this
Celebrex This drug was of no use to me. I have OA in my lower spine and celebrex never touched it.
little relief and painful side effects I had little relief and terribly painfull diarhea.
CELEBREX THE SIDE EFFECTS OF GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS MADE ME QUIT TAKING THIS MEDICATION. I NOTICED LITTLE RELIEF FROM THE PAIN IN MY HANDS WRISTS KNEES AND FEET. THE DOCTOR HAS SWITCHED ME TO BEXTRA 10MG. I HAVE BEEN TAKING IT FOR FOUR DAYS AND HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS.
"What a godsend... If it weren't for Celebrex, I wouldn't be able to move. I'm not able to use NSAIDS or aspirin because thanks to a former docter, he had me taking 800mg of Motrin 4 times a day & as a result it tore up my stomach. Celebrex is easier on my stomach with no side effects. I've been on Celebrex since 1998. I suffer from a WC knee injury(1997) and have been diagnosed with 3 bad discs in my lower back.(2001)"
Celebrex I thought this did better than it's partner. But I still have a lot of pain where I must take breaks in standing or walking any distance.
"Celebrex Celebrex is very expensive. It does allow me to walk to the mailbox and back and I didn't have to roll out of bed every morning. However, my insurance company would NOT cover this drug, hence making it so expensive that I had to quit taking it."
Celebrex Didn't work at all for me
"Not useful for headaches I spent several months using Celebrex for pain problems and I found that it had no effect on the frequency or levels of my headaches. This was problematic for me as the makers advise against taking any other NSAID while taking Celebrex, and I am allergic to Tylenol."
Celebrex No pain relief obtained from this product.
"Celebrex Although this medication was easy to get and my insurance paid for it, it did little or nothing to help the pain of OA. Sorry - its not the miracle cure its cracked up to be."
"Celebrex I started on 100mg twice a day and was increased to 200mg twice a day. It wore off too soon and was relatively ineffective. I was switched to Vioxx which has worked better for me, but has caused a fair amount of weight gain."
Works well with other RA meds Works well with other RA meds
Celebrex This med works great for my OA. I didn't realize how good it works until I stopped using it for a couple of days and the pain was unbearable. I highly recommend using this med for OA.
"It's ok I have taken celebrex for several months, at first I didn't think it made much difference until I ran out of them and had to wait a few days before I could get a new script from the Dr's. Well I gradually got pain and more pain and by the 3rd day I was taking Panadeine Forte, so now I know to always have my scripts ,Won't be doing that again..But I do find in a flare thay are useless even though I take one at night as well as morning at that time.But on a day to day basis keeping the aches and pains away I've found it to be a helpful medication."
celebrex I have been taking celebrex for over a year now. It helps with the swelling and inflamation. Does not completely stop the symptoms but works fairly well. I have had no sideaffects at all with this drug.
"Celebrex It worked quickly and well for my psoriatic arthritis and I had no recognizable side effects, but it did not touch my fibromyalgia, but at least I got relief from something."
celebrex much more likely to help than motrin type meds in FMS
"Celebrex Started out with 100mg.x 2/day and later increased to 200mg. x 2/day. Initially had some gastro distress and headaches, but these settled quickly. I found the 200mg. x 2/day to be most effective during the flare-up. However when trying to decrease this med, got pronounced re-bound pain for approx. one week with each decrease. This did settle, but was very difficult at the time."
No Help The side effect of stomach problems only made me feel worse. It did not help my muscle pain at all.
Celebrex I worked on the clinical trials of this drug and saw how effective it was for so many folks so was very anxious for it to come on the market. What a horrible disappointment - it did nothing for me! And it is very expensive.
"Celebrex Celebrex helped a little with my joints aching. It set my stomach on fire after a few days and worsened over time. Just before my dr. switched me to Vioxx, I was having blood in my stools and severe abdominal pain (possible bleeding)."
"No help here tried this medication I had upset stomach, swelling of hands and feet and no relief from the pain or stiffness."
"Have taken celebrex for many years.  Tried ibuprofen and Naproxen but no relief of joint pain, so physician ordered celebrex and it works.  Physician monitoring is needed but have not had any side effects."
Take Pepcid with it to prevent any Stomach problems.
"Take on extremely full stomach or suffer stomach  cramps/diarrhea. ..I have had recurring hairloss , probably twice a year but it grows back...I also get ringing and humming in my ears, pain relief outweighs annoying side effects though"
I have found it to relieve pain better than any thing I have tried before. Time will tell if it continues.  I plan on taking it daily as without a pain reliever I can not function with the osteoarthritus.
didn't appear to make significant difference. Require Endone to manage pain.
"I tried it for several months, and Celebrex just didn't work as well as Naproxen did. It also made me feel lethargic and depressed. As soon as I quit using it and went back to Naproxen I felt better."
Caused bloating and gassy
"very expensive if you are on medicare- if you are not, then you can get your prescription for 4$  other wise it is $1200 - rib off extraordinare"
Much better for the stomach. No bleeding like ibuprofen . Unfortunately the kidney doctors do not like it.
"I had stomach issues, tightness in chest that I've never had, and then started itching severely."

Works well for me as a pain reliever after multiple knee surgeries from being hit by a car.
"I had been self prescribing my arthritis pain relief by taking 8 tablets of Ibuprofen and 2 tablets of Tylenol Arthritis, daily. My physician warned that it wasn't good for my liver. He told me to discontinue the Ibuprofen and continue with Tylenol Arthritis, along with celecoxib. It did not help. My pain continued to worsen. Sometimes I can't walk at all. Then my health insurance decided to stop covering celecoxib as a generic. I didn't call in a refill. Have been without it for 10 days. Absolutely no difference in my pain level. It's proven itself as a useless drug, in my case."
Experiencing nausea and severe heartburn despite using with Pantoprazole.  Has had a modest effect on paid though.  Except now I have other problems.
"I was switched to this drug from Celebrex, and it was awful.  I actually didnâ??t realize they switched my me to a generic, because it looked the same, I never checked the label.  After 6 weeks of misery, including having to wear a thumb brace, get a knee brace, and could barely walk, X-rays, you name it, I realized the drug change.  I had to go through a bit of an ordeal to get my brand name Celebrex again, but as soon as I got back on it, the pain was gone.  This is not a suitable substitute for Celebrex.  "
It has relieved pain and swelling in knees so I can walk without pain. I do use generic and works fine.
4 months of pain with tennis elbow.  Lost 2 inches in length in the arm d/t pain and compensating but physician prescribed the drug and am totally pain free and length returned in arm.  Too bad I only have  a 14 day supply.  
I am dissappointed as I expected more pain relief. Dr put me on 200mg of Celecoxib to ween me off the copious quantities of Panadol and Ibuprofen that were no longer managing the pain from osteoarthritis in hip and knee. It is upsetting my stomach and I'm not getting the pain relief I hoped for.  
"I started taking this 3wks ago,my knuckles were the only thing swelling,but now all of my joints hurt,stopped taking it 3 days ago, hoping the pain will go away."
"I had back pain due to compression fracture on L-1, L-2. As i get old the disk starts to give me problems. It use to the insurance would let me have Celebrex. Now medicare would not allow brand name drugs only generic! This celecoxib does not do a thing! Taking it its like not taking anything! Doctor request celebrex, but medicare would not grand it!"
"I have taken Celebrex and the generic when it became available for many years for arthritis, particularly of the hands and spine. This particular generic does not work nearly as well as the previous capsules. I feel I have wasted my money on them and would have been better off with arthritis strength Tylenol. Very disappointed."
"I have been on 800mg motrin for my osteoarthritis for over 20 years. My doc said she wanted me off the motrin, and to try this. One pill per day is better than 3 pills per day, and I can't begin to describe how much I'm NOT in pain any longer!!! I feel almost NORMAL.  Yes, my knee still gives out sometimes, but that's to be expected when you are bone on bone.  But the pain is GONE!!!  It's wonderful to walk without pain, to sleep without pain, to FUNCTION without pain!!!  Oh, why did they keep me on the motrin for so long if this was around???"
This definitely does NOT work the same as the brand name.
works MUCH better than even the strongest pain meds. for my joint pain. Can't imagine going without it now.
Drowsiness and dizziness
"Celebrex and celecoxib are the EXACT SAME pill.  I complained to my doctor about the generic form and wanted the real celebrex back.  I still had some of the celecoxib and compared the two.  They are the same pill, same colors, same numbers (both have 7767 on 1 line, 200 on the 2nd line), everything.  EXCEPT that celebrex costs more than celecoxib.  What is up with this?"
Helped ease of movement after years of chronic and degerative spine.
I have  ankylosino spondolitis AS and pain in fingers & joints this is the only medicine that I can take and in 30 mins feel stiffness leave and have movement 
i havent took the medication because im afraid
