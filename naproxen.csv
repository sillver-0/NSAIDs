review
Amazing amazing amazing! They are like magic pills. I have to take mine 2 or 3 days before my period and they take my pain away. I sometimes don't have to take it on my first day. My cramps were so bad that they used to stop one day of my life completely- they were soo bad I would faint. Now I feel normal again and am not scared of my period!
"These work really well for me, reading these reviews I see they are not working for everyone. If I wasn't taking naproxen I couldn't walk to be honest. I'm waiting to have my spine fused due to my illness. My symptoms are back ache (gone) blood flow loss to legs (gone) severe tingles in legs (gone) numbness in hands and feet (gone) severe sharp pains on most movements (gone). For me this drug is great and I don't have the side effects as others have described. Give them a try it could work for you also, I wish you luck."
"Naproxen works well for my migraines. I always eat something or take it with milk to protect my stomach. If my migraine has progressed to me vomiting, I need to take maxalon and then wait for 30 mins to an hour, then I take naproxen (750mg) this knocks out the migraine pretty quickly for me, I will just feel pretty washed out for the rest of the day."
"Was prescribed prescription strength Naproxen for a Rotator Cuff injury, let me tell you....took it around dinner time and about 45 min later got the WORST stomach pain I’ve ever experienced. Has been going on for 3 hours now and stomach pain has not gotten any better. Considered going to the ER it’s that bad."
"I took the naproxen after eating some food, but I was waiting hours and nothing happened. I think that it lessened some of the pain because my period cramps are very the painful on the first day. But there was still pain that I couldn’t do some work on my laptop."
apo - naproxen sodium relieves my extremely severe period pain to the point where I can resume my daily activities instead of crying in bed
"You might get lucky and have no side affects  from naproxen. I  am 50 years old and got them for back pain just for three weeks till physio. Took them for 5 days 200mg twice a day.  My side effects were pain in kidney, stomach back, constipated. Trouble passing urine very sore.  I just hope they haven't messed my insides up.  I would say. Stay away from these. Oh and he tried to give me Gabapentin today checked side affects. No way I’m taking them. So pain for two weeks then physio. Better than option from doc"
"I started using this for my cramps in August when my mommy bought them for me and I would say it has really helped me the most in of all the pain relievers I've tried. I used to have very bad cramps: dizziness, vomiting and fatigue due to my low iron. It lasts very long so you don't even have to worry about taking another dose. It starts working in like 15 minutes or so."
Take 500mg Naproxen 2x a day which doesn’t do much of anything for my Ankylos Spondylitis. Ridiculous that it’s even recommended as part of AS treatment! On a side note as a woman it slows mensuration down to a trickle making mensuration last even longer which is extremely fricking annoying especially with AS!
"I have been suffering with period pain and heavy bleeding for 3 years (since the birth of my last baby).  I read a study on using Naproxen at the onset of your period for 5 days to help with pain and bleeding, so I decided it was worth a try.  I took 500 mg twice a day. The results are nothing less than amazing!  No clots, no need to stay at home and near a bathroom, no sleeping with towels under me at night, no pain and stress.  I feel like a normal human being!"
It took awhile to get naproxen in my bloodstream and I was having violent abdominal pains but after awhile I feel nothing
I have been experiencing upper back pain along with being achy. I would use a heating bad daily just to tolerate the pain. I was miserable until I started taking naproxen. I no longer lay in bed do to pain or an achy body  .
"I have taken Aleve for several different pain conditions knee pain, back pain,  joint pain, headaches  and it does absolutely nothing. I get more pain relief from taking nothing! Sad! This medication is a waste of money."
"Would only recommend taking  naproxen if you’re in extreme pain. It works for that very well. But I had a horrific experience with the side effects of Naproxen (OTC). An hour after taking it I felt stranger than I have in my entire life: dizzy, sweating PROFUSELY, lightheaded and sort of as if the room was spinning, felt the need to run to bathroom but nothing happened. Spent that night feeling chilled and bizarre with a pounding heart and SEVERE anxiety. Exactly a week later and I still feel very anxious and lightheaded at times. It took several days for most of the side effects to go away. Can still feel it seven days later. Worked well for my mom’s shoulder pain but gave her strange side effects too."
"I have osteoarthitis in both of my hips, knees, and two herniated discs in my lower back, I go to the gym three times a week and at times, those areas will get sore, after taking the Aleve for back and muscle pain, it relieve it great!"
"Took naproxen x2 500g pills for on-going back pain. The medication made absolutely no difference to the pain levels and as an added bonus, my-oh-my did it upset my stomach. I had to leave work and rush home, most probably got a few speeding tickets on the way home, and I haven’t left the bathroom since. Might have to buy a new toilet once my system passes these. 

Back still hurts too, what a day."
"Using for the first time Naproxen, ( imprint = INZA 500) I'm in Australia

Usual meds for an attack include;
(1) Diclofenac (Volatren)75ml 
(2) Colchicine (Colgout) 500mic
(3) Allopurinol 1 per day (I ran out 3mnths ago)
(4) Tramadol 50ml last resort b/c its 
rare, VERY hard to get, and highly addictive. 
I had an attack at work which hit my top left ankle like an arrow. It only took an hour and I was hobbling, I took my lunch break ate a muffin and popped an naproxen INZA 500. OMG Its incredible!
Withinn 10 mins the pain began to disolve, within 20 mins I could stand and bear the pain. In 30-50 mins Im beginning to walk without hobbling or hopping.
I lie to you not by the time im driving home and hanging up my work jacket its almost nothing. No pain, Im walking as if nothing happened, I can still feel a type of numbness or stiffness where the pain was but its so insignificant.
I can sleep good tonight. Thank you INZA 500"
"I was prescribed by my Rheumy to take Sulfasalazine 500 mg tab 4 times a day since October 2018, when I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. I have also taken Naproxen 375mg as needed. I’m a 72 years old woman still working full time in front of a computer all day and sometimes my back and neck pain is unbearable. The only thing that reduces my pain is taking Aleve gels before I leave for work as Sulfasalazine nor Naproxen have done enough."
"Told my doctor Naproxen does not work for me.  He said yes it will.......pain before was 7-8 out of 10 now after taking it pain still 7-8 out of 10.  I have been up for heading towards 48 hours without sleep due to excessive pain and discomfort.  Disappointment cannot begin to describe.....
This medication was useless the past two time it was prescribed to me and here I am again with a useless prescription and no pain relief. I may need to find a doctor that listens to their patients."
I'm currently taking naproxen for my joint pain but it's not helping me at all I feel the same
"Aleve does nothing for me.  I bought some because people, including doctors, constantly tell me how good it is for all kinds of pain.  It does NOTHING for me.  I've used it for headaches, neck pain, joint pain - zero pain relief.  Two Advil are way, way more effective.  I feel like I've wasted money on a completely useless drug. Won't ever buy it again."
"Taking about one to two 500mg naproxen  a day for chronic migraines depending on the pain level, never noticed any side effects. However after a few months of being on it, it rarely seems to help"
Took it for one day and it started getting painful ulcers. In so much pain for my ulcers can't sleep.
"Just a quick comment.  
I have had gout for 5 or so years, both feet, sides, tops, toes and occasionally in my knees.
The only drug I have found to work is Naproxen (Feminax Ultra in the UK). 
Catching it early is key as previous posts, 500mg at start, and I top up with paracetamol after 3 hours, then take 250mg Naproxen 3 hours after, followed by 2 paracetamol 3 hours after and a 500mg before bed.  If you don’t catch it early enough, it can last days, my longest so far has been 8 days.  
I also take cherry extract capsules daily, along with celery seed extract.  If you can find them, dark red cherries help flush out the kidneys and are a natural anti inflammatory, so once a week a top up of these won’t do you any harm, nor will bananas every day."
"I have arthritis. I have been taking naproxen for a few months  two 500mg tablets a day. But have had terrible muscle pain in the calf’s  at the back of both legs , and could hardly walk so stopped then , and it seems to be  better"
Pointless doesn’t touch pain
"I purchased liquid capsules Aleve for a headache. I took 2 and I didn't experience any relief at all over a 10 hour period. The pills are very large, but the gel capsule made swallowing easier. I wouldn't purchase these again."
"Gouty arthritis: fair
Arthritic shoulder: good"
"500mg of prescription Naproxen stopped my daily migraines. I had been  taking over the counter meds non stop all day to try and control them, and I was getting no where.  I had been  spending about $60 per month or more on useless tylenol rapid release or advil liquid gels. I really think they are just a placebo to get people to spend money. My headaches would get so bad I'd throw up or have to go to the emergency. This drug is a miracle for me. I strongly recommend asking your dr for a prescription if OTC meds don't help you either."
"I was given Naproxen by my doctor for lower back pain and it really worked well. The pain reduced a lot and I could sleep better. The only problem is that it make my stomach feel uneasy and a little sick at times. It also gave me gas and changed my stool. 

I’d only ever take it again if pain is unbearable, otherwise I’d rather go through the pain until it gets better rather.

However, very effective at reducing the back pain to almost no pain and that’s why I rated it 8."
It helped my headache just a little. I really need to find a better headache medicine.
"This medicine works excellent for my period pain. Ibuprofen works good, but not as good as Aleve does. I am very happy. I never tried it for my headaches."
Pulled an intercostal working out. 1 week on  naproxen  500 mg twice a day and I was back to going to the gym lightly on the second week while still taking it. Fully recovered after 3 weeks.
"Naproxen is excellent for period pain. I have a heavy 5 day flow with excruciating cramps. I read a study about higher does of naproxen being taken a few days BEFORE your period starts, as a way to reduce flow. Well it worked for me! Days before I'm scheduled to start my period, I take 880mg of naproxen, once a day for no more than 2 days. It reduced my period significantly. By day 3 there's hardly any bleeding at all. I'm no longer bed bound or writhing in pain and can enjoy my day. I wish I had known about it sooner."
Aleve takes away almost all of the pain. More helpful than any other drug or method I’ve tried to help with period pain.
I took three 500 milligram naproxen and it didn’t help  my period pain whatsoever
Both generic naproxen and brand name at 500mg prescription did nothing to help with pain/inflammation and again not good for the stomach to be on too long.
Aleve is the ONLY drug that has worked for my horrible period pain!
Naproxen works absolutely amazing for period pain. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has really bad cramps or pain during their period.
"I am waiting for hip surgery as osteoarthritis set in due to an accident in my youth. My left leg has always been shorter and I've had Osteopath treatment off an on, though pain has never stopped me leading a very active life. The pain now is appalling, Panadol and Ibobrufen help but I still limp painfully. Have a little indigestion as well. I thought weight-gain i was having was due to lack of mobility but it was bloating side effect due to the Brufen.  I can't take codeine so was prescribed Naproxyn as Ibobrufen wasn't cutting it for the pain. Naproxyn took a few days to even work and the pain was not alleviated enough to warrant putting up with extreme queasiness, flatulence, slight depression (Can't afford to start down a negative track before my operation with so much pain ahead!). Back on Ibuprufen despite the bloating."
"Naproxen did not help with my pain, I've taken it for toothaches and cramps, just ended up hurting my stomach instead."
lower back pain  was getting worse - like breathtaking nerve pinching but on Nparoxen and I am now pain free
I broke my wrist. There was a terrible amount of swelling in my entire hand. The was pain just touching it.  I started taking Aleve. Two pills a day and the swelling went down in my fingers and thumb. I started taking three a day(the maximum) and the swelling went down in the back of my hand. I can see my knuckles for the first time in three months. I can start get strength in the hand to go back to work.
I have been taking norco 5mg a day for a bad lower back pain and of course this really did remove all pain. But many countries don't have this drug so my pharmacy said to try Aleve. I was so surprised that I still can't believe that it took 95% of my pain away. I travel with Aleve and won't have problems in bringing drugs into other countries.
"At times, I suffer from back pain although it's been much better the past 6 years.  Also from throbbing shoulder and hands, at times.  Enough pain and throbbing to stop me from doing anything, including sleeping.  I had been taking a low dose Oxycodone, which relieved pain within 15 minutes.  I still have 7 of those left from 2017, thank goodness.  Even though they've turned yellow over the years, I still take one about once a month when the pain is bad. I asked my doctor about this and she said Oxycodone doesn't go bad, so to take when needed.  She also said they couldn't prescribe Oxycodone any longer because of because people abuse them.  Well, I don't have not abused them, but because of others, not just me but others have to suffer?  Somethings not right here.  She did prescribe 500mg of Naproxen.  Good grief, why even bother taking it?  Absolutely zero relief."
"Been taking Naproxen for 4 years, always helps me with my herniated disc when it bulges.I have a history of taking codeine, vicodins, tamadol and etc all those pills do is take away your senses of pain that goes to your brain instead of actually healing it. I have a broken leg with 30 screws and my shoulder too, take my advice in what helps - naproxen takes time but will heal whatever you have plus it's a non narcotic will pass any drug test. 
 I've been working for 8 years in a plant operating all sorts of stuff with out this medication I would be in bed collecting disability...Naproxen is the best"
I broke my neck and had to have surgery to fix it  and the pain is very bad. My doctor gave me Naproxen and I took it but after taking it the pain was so much worse. I will never take Naproxen again.
"I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg after going through severe post period cramps, I have tried Advil and Tylenol but none of them worked. I must confess, Naproxen does the job for me for the period pain, I am back to school studying. I feel really sleepy tho, I don't know if that's one of the side effects of taking the drug."
"I suffer with chronic backpain, Naproxen is the only painkiller to ease it. Take it with Omeprazole though as it can give you stomach ulcers/bleeding which I had when I was taking it everyday. I now just take it as and when required and with omeprazole"
"I've never had a bad experience with Aleve for period pain. I take it before my period even starts but if I do get cramps the day of, I can pop one, take a nap, and the pain is gone!"
"I have stage 4 Endometriosis and in turn have terrible period cramps. I took Advil for years, but found that it always made me nauseous and just feel really out of it. I finally took the suggestion on my friends who has bad period pain and took Aleve. I take 2 at the first sign of cramps and find that the relief lasts awhile. 
I use to take 4 extra strength liquid advils in 24 hours, now I can take 1-2 regular Aleves' and I don't get nauseous or feel weird."
"I have taken naproxen today for neck pain, it is really effective took away pain so I can focus."
Aleve is fantastic for tendonitis in my Achilles' tendons.  You'd have a fight on your hands if you took my Aleve away from me!  :)
Was prescribed therapeutic dosage Naproxen (6 220mg per day for 7-10 days) and immobilizing with strap pressure 1 below tendon for tennis elbow. This was 10 yrs ago and tendonitis never came back.
Aleve back and muscle pills are garbage they don't work. Purchased the product twice and both times they did nothing even after taking 3 both times straight garbage should discontinue product rip off with a hyped up name.
"Not a great help and addiction ads really irritate a person in pain, get real"
"I have extremely painful period cramps. So bad that I've even passed out from them. Every single month I would throw up all day from the pain. I had tried every medication, then my doctor suggested Naproxen 500mg. What a miracle ! once kicks , I feel no cramps ! and for me , one pill lasts for 12+ hours. I can finally live a normal life :) the only downside is it does upset my stomach, so I take it with an anti emetic !"
"500 mg of Naproxen when I have menstrual cramps works wonders! I normally have really bad pain when I get my period but once the Naproxen kicks in, I no longer feel that pain. Totally recommend it."
"I was diagnosed with AS in the summer a year ago. Prescribed naproxen- 1000mg per day, I take it first thing on the morning. [Should really take it in the morning] calms the pain to a dull ache rather than pain, can absolutely tell it’s working - reduces the pain, but not the constant chronic ache ... I’d be lost without it tho "
"Hi i'm 30 years old, I have had gout flare ups since I was a little kid some severe enough to cause surgery to have to be performed. I get flare ups in both feet from my toes all the way to my ankles. In some cases it has happened in my lower spine, I have taken almost anything under the sun to try and alleviate the pain, pills, teas and patches. Maybe my body chemistry is different than most but indomethacin is the best possible thing I've found for when the pain is unbearable. Yes there are some side effects, but we can all agree we wouldn't be here if we didn't know the piercing, debilitating pain of gout and when it's that bad a few little side effects don't bother me when it attacks the pain like it does, good luck with it."
After 2 and a half months of consistent gout flare ups. Indomethicin gave relief with lots of side effects. Weeks of Ibuprofen with no results. Switched to Naproxen and pain subsided immediately. All swelling gone the following day. No side effects like the Indomethicin. Feet are smaller than they have been in a long time. Even my work boots are loose now.
"I'm 31. First time I've ever had an acute gout attack on my left foot big toe. This pain had me in tears. I'm a stubborn guy and normally don't take meds for anything. This pain forced me to find a doctor, who ended up prescribing Naproxen 500 mg. It works, but not as fast as I would have liked it to. I was still in pain 2 hours after taking it. Crying my eyes out. 4 hours later the pain was lessened. But not by much. Still enough for me to fall asleep. 6-8 hours later pain had lessened but not by much it was still uncomfortable to fall asleep....also a slight discomfort in my stomach (side effect?).  After 11 hours later throbbing needle pain that I've been feeling has subsided 90 percent.  I took my second dose and it's been maintaining so far. However, I still can barely walk. Hurts when I stand on it... it's been 2 full days with this gout thing."
Late life diagnosis of AS (6 months ago) - part of my cervical spine is already fused.  Taking 1000 mg a day (500/twice a day) has helped a lot. I drink a lot of water and always take it with food.
Prescribed 500mg twice a day of naproxen along with codeine and oramorph for my first sciatic episode.  I stopped the oramorph after a couple of days as I hated the way it made me feel and the codeine lasted about 5 days. Now had 5 days of just the naproxen. The pain is unbearable in the morning and don't know if the pain goes to a manageable level because I start to move or because my morning dose has kicked in. I'm getting some weird side effects like numb fingers and bad stomach pains so I don't know if i should quit taking the drug to see if i still need it or not?
If you have painful period cramps I totally recommend this. It helps me a lot.
Please be aware cause extreme bleeding inside your body do not take unless I absolutely have to does not even help with pain like it's supposed to
Took 3 Aleve liqued gels within 2 hrs and it progressive made my headache worse and I had an event to go to later that evening too. Not very reliable. Advil works more effectively even if I have to take 3+
"2013/14 took 2 Aleve every a.m. for knees. I found myself feeling weak - like going to pass out. Went to primary next day.  Checked blood count and did the rectal blood. Told my SO to get me to emergency now.   Blood count 7 and needed transfusion. Had endoscopy.  Released after 3 days -blood normal. Told to see gastro upon my release. Over the next week had colonoscopy, intestinal exam, and lastly capsule endoscopy - swallow a small capsule camera to film 8 hours going through my body.  Dr and I reviewed the results. Three places in intestines indicated bleeding - I could see them.  He asked me food or meds I was taking - Aleve had caused the bleeding as it is a  NSAID. I can't take any NSAID and nothing with aspirin in it or I may bleed.  So now I basically live w/o taking anything for pain.  ALEVE - Read the package - very small print - may cause BLEEDING."
I give it a 1 because 0 is not an option. This medicine has never helped me relieve any kind of pain.  :{
"This is my first time using Aleve and it has worked wonders for me. I cannot believe how well it has worked so far! I have had severe cramps since I was 12 years and have tried so many pain relievers that haven't worked so well. I took 2 pills about 20 minutes after I started cramping and 20 minutes later, I was all good! For 24 hours! The third day is usually my worst but I took two pills and I was good for about 17 hours then I took 1 pill and I was good for another 9 hours. And it doesn't make me nauseated! So glad I found this, I just hope it keeps on working like this."
"I have AS and have been in a flare up for about a week now. Hurting from my pelvis to my feet, it was causing extreme difficulty with walking.  Haven’t wanted people to notice the few times I’ve had to get out of the house so would walk decently with excruciating pain. My feet have been hurting everywhere, with painful throbbing and stabbing pain with every step.  I have been feeling “shocks” in my left hip area with my steps, almost sending me to the floor at times.  Last night, after I got in bed, the throbbing pain was keeping me awake so I got up and took two Aleve gel tabs.  Within 30 min, while lying in bed, I noticed the throbbing had stopped.  Upon awakening and standing I was much better.  I could not believe the difference in my gait with my pain level dropping significantly today.  I feel so much better now!  Thank goodness"
"I tore my trapezius and was prescribed naproxen and co-codamol. I was fine during the day time on this cocktail and took it with food as instructed. On the first night I was awoken in the early hours with the most excruciating stomach pain, nausea and dizziness. My stomach feels tender to the touch. Researched both drugs online and naproxen is the clear culprit. Not taking it again."
"I have been taking Ibuprofen for years but only helped a little 
I saw commercial for Aleve and thought I would try What a difference in my back pain and sciatica.
It even took down the inflammation in my hands"
Had 5 days of bad bleeding but just 1 dose of 220 mg it went down to med flow.
"I found it as most effective medication for cervical pain with compression syndrome, with minimal or no side effects.  I've  being taken at night after meal for many years. Just do not overdose! and find minimal effective dose for your condition. Naproxen is the best!"
"I took one aleve pill and with in 10 minutes it helped my body regulate the severe symptoms. I am happy about aleve , I have not tried any other medicine yet."
Sciatica pain was severe and switched from ibuprofen Advil to naproxen Aleve and found absolutely no difference whatsoever. Excruciating pain never subsided and barely took the edge off. Am now trying AC&C which has always worked as a pain killer for me probably due to the mix if Aspirin Caffeine and Codeine. I have read that sciatica does not necessarily need an anti inflammatory. At least I slept 5 hours straight on AC&C
"I have had rheumatoid arthritis for over 25 years. I have always found that if I take only 200 mg naproxen or ibuprofen with water and some food an hour before going to bed, I have very little morning stiffness in my hands or feet. It makes a world of difference to me taking it before bed time."
"I took prescription-strength naproxen after a shoulder injury. It helped with that but made pain in my knees and hips much much worse somehow. 

When I take it my shoulder feels better for a few hours but my knees start to ache."
"I take a few of these in a gout attack  and soon relieves the pain and I can walk again !!

Super"
"I too cannot believe how well Aleve works! I've had bad cramps, pain and misery that lasted for two days, interrupting my life every month and giving a feeling of dread each time 'that time' approached. My sister mentioned recently that Aleve helped her, so I tried it. For the second month now, I am able to function with pretty mild symptoms! It's a miracle. So happy to have found this!! Wish I'd known about it 10 years ago, to think the suffering was so simply solved. So grateful."
Dr prescribed these for severe back pain along with co-codamol nothing is touching the pain. However they do both send me to sleep 
I took naproxen 500 mg late Tuesday night with food as told and by early hours Wednesday I was in real bad pain stomach cramps and wind and didn't help at all with the pain for my back. All day Wednesday back pain was just as bad and cramps too. The cramps stopped about 8pm Wednesday night and my stomach hasn't been right since just wondering if anyone else has as same thing happen to them.
"As a mail carrier, I walk 11 miles a day for the last 22 years. Inflammation in my knees has really affected me, making my day difficult and painful to get the job done. 2 Aleve gelcaps work WONDERS and in less than 10 minutes!"
Has been amazing for my period pain. Nothing seemed to work and I would be up all hours of the morning not being able to sleep. The pain was so unbearable. My doctor the prescribed 500mg naproxen and it’s been a life saver I’m now able to stop skipping work and social events. Takes about 30-40 mins to completely kick in and I don’t feel any pain. Haven’t noticed any side effects.
"Naproxen helps me with my diagnosed Major Mood Disorder (MMD) and Post Traumatic Disorder chronic symptoms.I   have observed during periods of my suffering pain, I experience a significant positive shift in my outlook on life (more hopeful and full of positive physical energy and mentally able to concentrate while multitasking). No side effects felt. I am middle age African American male taking this medication for osteoarthritis of foot and other pain symptoms."
"I took naproxen, and I haven’t gotten my period for two months, and it still hasn’t come, I’ll keep everyone updated."
Relieved back pain but resulted in  bad heartburn
"Took 1 tablet each night for ten days. Dealt with pain, occasionally felt nausea, last night felt pain all over, from head to toe and red blood blister appeared on arm, plus skin sore to touch."
"I have gout arthritis osteoarthritis , and probably tendinitis I have had a very hectic sporting life ,

I first went onto diclofenac but was put on naproxen safer drug I found them both brilliant had no side effects but I am concerned of the long term side effects , you can't stop the aging process    but this helps , and if you start a fitness regime hopefully theses will help with the pain when getting there ."
"For at least 7 years, I have taken one aleve before going to sleep every night for osteoarthritis pain in my lower back. It has worked marvellously.  Unfortunately I can no longer take Aleve as I have stage 3 kidney disease which my doctor is attributing to long term usage of Aleve. I now take a low dosage Tylenol but it does not work near as well as the Aleve ..."
"For several years I took Bayer Back & Body for my chronic back/sciatica pain (2 tabs, 2x day). I found very little relief. I recently started taking Aleve Back & Muscle Pain..This is my third day using Aleve Back & Muscle Pain...What a difference in just 3 days!!! I take 1 tab in the morning and it last all day!! The pain/burning sensation in my back/leg has reduced sufficiently. Thank You Aleve!!!"
"Ever since I was 16 or so, I have had extremely painful menstrual cycles. I will feel uncomfortable a couple of days before bleeding and then hit like a freight train, the first day of bleeding and usually leading into day 2. The kind of pain where I can't think straight and feel the urge to vomit and poop all at once. I have often had to miss work due to the severity of pain. Finally after being fed up with Ibuprofen not working at all anymore, I went to a dr and was prescribed naproxen 500mgs. I find that when I take one 500mg pill at the first tinge of pain, I am usually experiencing relief within 30 minutes. I also find that when I drink LOTS of water with the dosage it kicks in even sooner than 30 minutes. In hind-sight I wish I would have known about naproxen when I was in my teens."
"For a disabling gout flare: 500mg then 250mg every 8 hrs or if pain not cleared then 2x 250mg twice or up to 3x (ie 3x doses 500mg each) max (rarely need 3x).
Way better than colchicine but GP reckons colchicine protects body better than naproxen- much more research needed.
"
"A complete joke.  I just went to the emergency room from a fall.  Torn rotator cuff and ligaments, prescribed naproxen.  Has not touched the pain.  Then I’m reading it’s great for menstrual cramps and headaches, but not for this.  Thanks to the ER Dr - NOT."
"Seems like when I take Aleve for my bad shoulder pain due to severe arthritis,I get a headache."
I have never taken Aleve before. Dr recommended for my trigger finger (inflammation)  it did help. Took the round blue pill 220mg one after dinner. 4 tables in four days. I’m stopping it today as I got a sore throat out of the blues. Could it be a reaction.. ? I’m pretty healthy and I know taking medications is not my forte. Still I know it did help.
"Got given it after I popped my knee out of place. Doctor didn't know what was wrong but causing me so many problems after. I'm aching and hurting all over. My hands hurt, yesterday I couldn't even move my wrist, my feet and ankles hurt, depressed etc. I stopped taking it, feel less sad but I'm still aching."
"Worked better than Tylenol to control fever, and works longer. 1g Tylenol brought my 101 fever down to 99, while 440mg of Naproxen sodium knocked the same 101 fever the next morning down to my normal temp of 96."
Although it's a great pain reliever for my son it has caused terrible stomach pains and a flare of asthma. They worst was anaphylaxis and a trip to the A&E. No more naproxen for us :(
"I am overweight which brings more unnecessary pain to my cramps, as well as having bad cramps runs in my family. I am not new to naproxen but one day when I woke up at night in severe pain where I wanted to poop, puke and die, I took one and hopped in n the shower. Roughly 20 minutes for me to feel 80 better and because of that I’m grateful."
"My dr put me on naproxen after he gave me shots in my knees for pain which were no help.  I'm still in pain,  it's like taking an asprin, what a waste of my money.  "
"My second-day cramps are usually so terrible that I cannot get out of bed. I've tried Pamprin, Midol, and other pain relievers for my menstrual cramps and none of them helped with the pain. Aleeve is the only one that works for me. If I take 2 and then take a short nap, my cramps are completely gone when I wake up."
Very good for neck ache. Usually pain disappears within eight mins/
"Ever since I could remember I always had the worst period cramps. I would miss school, work, parties, you name it for the first 2 days of my flow because the pain was just too much to handle. I threw up every month, felt weak, faint and had a hard time even getting out of bed. A year ago I finally decided I've had enough and do not deserve to go through this pain monthly. My doctor prescribed me Naproxen 500, and although it certainly isn't a miracle worker, I am now able to go on with my life and complete my day to day tasks. The discomfort is still mildly there, but I am just so happy to not be on the toilet puking each month from the severe pain. I am able to function with Naproxen and it has helped me significantly."
I have awful period cramps and this did not help at all
It's the only one that works for me. I'm having a lot of cramps and pain every month and the first day I have to stay in my bed but with this medication everything is going away! When I notice the first symptoms I take it and after 20 Minutes I have nothing. I need to take it only one time in the first day. I have zero side effects.
"I've been using Aleve for a couple years now for my period pain. Taking one gel capsule right as I start feeling pain seems to get rid of it altogether within about 10mins! I never really trusted that drugs worked well until I used Aleve. Now, I got my last wisdom tooth pulled yesterday. The dentist suggested Tylenol (500mg)+Advil (600mg), and wrote me a prescription for percocet (which I haven't filled yet) if I'd rather that. Tried the Tylenol/Advil combo. Barely worked. Couldn't sleep and early morning I grabbed my Aleve to see if that would help... Pain is pretty much gone unless I move that area of the mouth. I love Aleve. I put 9/10 because it failed me just once with my period. (It's possible I took it too late though.)"
I took a first dose of two like instructed for body pain and gave me an instant horrible headache that has lingered a bit.
"I've been taking naproxen for a couple of months for severe cramps and it has been working wonders. Two a day on day 2 of my cycle and I'm good, then maybe 1/2 on day 3 going into day 4.
My only side effect this month is that my cycle has stayed on a little longer.  It's usually 6 days max....and now I'm on day 8, so hopefully the end is near !!  I'll definitely try it again next month !!"
"Pharmacist offered this for joint/muscle pain, related to unknown condition (possibly beginning of rheumatoid or reactive arthritis).  After I took 220mg, it made me calm, painless, but I also felt kind of isolated, and deeply depressed. An irrational feeling of untouchable, undefinable empty sadness. I felt very bad, could not stop the whole experience. I was happy it was the end of the day and so I went to bed. The painkiller effect and anti inflammatory effect was however very effective. It erased all my pain in my muscles. But be careful, if you are sensitive. I did not have suicidal thoughts, but I was close to it! I felt if I would watch a very sad documentary about all the bad things humans did."
"I picked up some aleve and took it when my tendonitis flared up and 
 it did nothing.  I had to take the generic brand of ibprophen  before I could get some rest."
Soon as I feel a little cramping coming on when my period starts I take 2 aleves and my cramps are gone for majority of the day if not the whole day.
"Experienced a neck injury (occipital neuralgia) so had Cervical Neuralgia / Occipital Neuralgia.  The Dr. prescribed naproxen.  Now that I have experienced a horrible, terrible and destructive medical condition directly from naproxen, I strongly recommend to everyone, if this drug is prescribed to you, drop the prescription into the toilet and run away as fast as you can!!! This horrible drug depleted my iron to the stage of anemia, which of course depletes CBC count in hematology. Now I am in 6-7 months of slowly rebuilding my iron, which rebuilds hematology."
"Of the various OTC pain medications I have tried, Aleve has worked the best.  Though I'm not so much of a stickler when it comes to only buying name brands (oftentimes I've found that generics work just fine), I find that the name-brand Aleve has more of a positive effect for me than generic naproxen.  Nevertheless, I keep a bottle of Aleve nearby at all times.  It truly helps."
"I am a 65 yr old, female in excellent health except that I have ankle & knee pain . On vacation I, daily, took 500mg Naproxen for 3 weeks due to a mis-step and slight fall. Upon return home, 1 month later I am having extreme hair loss."
"I cracked a molar vertically into TWO pieces. After the initial two days (wherein a strong muscle relaxant was added to the mix) two Aleve for each dose kept me comfortable (nearly pain free unless I chewed on it) until I could get my quotes for a dental implant and get the offending tooth extracted.  I am post extraction as of today and again, two Aleve per dose has allowed me to bypass the opiod pain management ALTOGETHER!  Highly pleased and will keep Aleve as my go
to pain intervention for intense pain wherein speed of results is the only option. "
"After five consecutive days of being in constant and intolerable pain, the only medicine that reduced my pain was Naproxen 500 mg. No other medication or herbal medicine or ice helped me previously until I took Naproxen maybe because I have Celiac Disease  Today after taking Naproxen is the first day I feel with less pain! after taking one pill."
"This is the only pain medication I have taken that helps with my menstrual pain. This includes back pain, cramping, headaches, and pain in my hip. By alleviating the pain it also helps alleviate the nausea caused by the pain. With that being said, I have never had a negative side effect while using this medication."
"I had a toe injury and I took Aleve extra strength. Let me just say, this was the best decision I could have made. I went from not being able to walk in the morning, to jumping off a stage. I HIGHLY recommend Aleve. I have never been so impressed with a medication. I wish I could shoot a commercial for Aleve because they deserve it."
Aleve really worked for me with my toe swelling for the gout and  the relief was  very fast for me.  It is Awesome
I heard/felt something in my shoulder tear ( Torn tendon in shoulder ). Went to Dr when ibuprofen and paracetamol no longer worked. Prescribed 500mg naproxen twice day. This was last wed. It's now Sunday and the constant dull pain down my arm has come back. The naproxen worked really well for about 48 hours. It didn't stop the agony every morning. Painful when changing gear when driving (UK). Have MRI scan in 10 days. No side effects although my hot flushes ( menopause) seem to have got much worse over the last 2 days ( on clonidine for those)
"I’m 40 and I’ve had about two gout attacks a year for the last 4 years. They have all been on my left big toe although currently this one is in my left heel. When I get a flare up there is no stopping it. Not indocin, naproxen, prednisone nothing! I take Allopurinol daily. Note* I just started taking Allopurinol this year and I felt like it was helping me. I made it to November. But here I am all over again. I’m am 6ft 245lb. I do exercise quite a bit. Have a active lifestyle. I’ve worked with my primary physician, podiatrist and now I’m being referred to a Rheumatologist. Hope they have some new ideas. I have  Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) from work for this, but I’m on my 7th day with this and it’s not getting better. I still worry about missing work. Stressed over here! "
"Aleve has been a miracle drug for me. I’m not one to write reviews on anything but I can tell you from my experience today that I was in so much pain from menstrual cramps that I was crying. I took two extra strength Tylenol and it took two hours to work and when it did work I still felt a lot of pain but still not as much as before. Then, I took two Aleve and it completely knocked it out."
"I was just prescribed naproxen 500 mg for degenerative arthritis. It really takes the pain away from the arthritis but it also works for my wife who gets occasional menstrual headaches, migraines  and seasonal allergy sinus headaches. She also takes vistaril for allergies but it doesn't get rid of the headaches. Me personally, only Excedrin migraine extra strength...but that might be the caffeine lol"
I was switched to naproxen for heavy periods due to mefenamic supply problems. I have continued with it as I found it reduced my flow more than mefanmic acid did. In terms of pain Naproxen certainly eases the pain from menstruation cramping but doesn’t eliminate it to a comfortable level and I was having to take regular paracetamol on top. A few months ago I was prescribed buscopan for IBS and my GP advised me to use it for period cramps too. To my surprise the combination of naproxen and buscopan has helped greatly during my period and when I’m ovulating. So  I rarely need to stay curled up in bed clutching a hot water bottle like I used to have to do.
"I had an attack of gout yesterday. Had to crawl to the toilet. Got a relative to buy me some naprogesic as it is called here and 8 hours later am almost pain free. 
It leaves everything else for dead."
Had a tooth pulled three days ago have been taking this every chance I could. Doesn't seem to help with pain at all maybe I need a higher dosage than 300 mg because I'm only allowed to take 2 a day.
"Herniated disc T4 and narrowing of spinal column in my neck. Over last few years I have suffered from flare ups of back pain which spread throughout the spine and into other joints and this has deteriorated after the herniated disc. I am guessing this is a type of arthritis.

The good news is naproxen works well and quickly and settles everything down within 1 to 2 days.  I don't like to keep taking it but after a week or two the pain returns and I need the drugs again and I am starting to think the pain is returning quicker and more severe to the extent that I may be more and more reliant?

However, 18 months after the herniated disc and thinking I might not walk properly again I'm running again and pain free on the drugs."
I have tried many brands of Naproxen.  It has never relieved even the mildest of my pain.  I had no inflammation relief either.
"I went to the doctor after having pain in my elbow, I thought tennis elbow my doctor dismissed it as tendonitis an quickly prescribed me Naproxen 500mg to be taken twice daily. I made sure I took after food on the and third day in I started experiencing stomach pain and indignation/ heart burn.  This continued over next 2 days with increased pain and feeling bloated, on the fifth day a stiffness started creeping in all over my body so bad that I couldn't take my own clothes off.  It is now day 6 I haven't taken any tablets and had to spend the day in bed. It has even made my breasts feel very sore. I feel as though I've been in an horrendous car crash.  I will definitely not be taking this drug ever again. I'm usually a very fit 49 year old,"
Does nothing may as well take sugar pills
This works well on arthritis and gout and I only take when I need it. You can buy this OTC as naproxen it is fairly cheap this way. I always have something in stomach before taking.
"I'm 6'8 and 128kg. Was prescribed 500mg twice a day.
Experienced extreme dizziness and light headedness. Felt very faint. Not a chance I could drive, I couldn't even walk in a straight line."
"2 Weeks ago I developed severe lower back pain, I went to my chiropractor for 2 treatments thinking this would solve the problem, was out of action for a week. Then it flared up again just when I thought it was gone. I am supposed to be starting a new job on Monday, but woke up Saturday morning in severe pain down my left leg, throbbing burning pain, and my ankle and foot had no feeling..... so all I have is a tablet called INZA and paracetemol, I can't drive the manual car to the doctor to get an injection as I can't even walk properly and have no feeling in the leg. I'm seeing the physio on Monday, I wonder if this will help as they do work the muscles which might help the disk go back to normal, is this going to be a life long problem?"
"It seems like other OTC pain relief pills work much better, e.g. ibruprofen, aspirin, tylonol.  I just try to get by on one aleve taken around 5 a.m.  because I take four other pills each day at 5 p.m.   I have just experienced several days with dizzyness.  Don't know if it's connected to taking Aleve but will address it with my family doctor."
"My Dr prescribed 500mg  twice a day as needed for mu shoulder pain.  I immediately had stomach pain and nausea so I  only took it once daily at bedtime as my shoulder pain is worse at night.  Pain went away but the nausea and stomach pain is back along with headaches.  I quit completely 3 days ago; nausea and headache still present at times but getting better.  Naproxen is history for me, never again.  Good old Tylenol will have to do from now on."
I take all types of pain meds but Naproxen doesn't last an hour before my cramps come back. I just took one and it made my cramps worse and I'm like forget naproxen. One pill doesn't do jack.
"I have mild arthritis which gives me pain primarily in my hands, wrists & ankles.  I take (2) 220 mg naproxen sodium before I walk 9 holes of golf in western PA which involves serious hills.  I think it definitely helps me but wonder how long before I anticipate golfing I should take the naproxen sodium, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours?"
Been taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for 12 days per docs order with little relief for Chostocondritis and back pain.   Getting pretty bummed out so decided to try Aleve (not generic - the time release isn't the same) and within hours had relief.  Finally able to sit comfortably!
"Naproxen has not helped my pain one bit. I've been on one 1000mg tablet a day for 3 weeks. I've had so many side effects to this medication but my Dr doesn't care and told me to keep taking it. I'm also on 1800mg a day of gabapentin (for nerve related pain) 40-60mg of oxycodone a day (for back pain; 2 prolapsed discs as well as spinal stenosis and age degeneration) and 30mg of baclofen (muscle relaxer) even being on all these tablets I still can't walk or stand for more than 15 minutes at a time unless I have my crutches or a trolley to take weight off. I also have nerve damage to my right leg (to the point my slipper caught on fire whilst camping and I didn't know until I smelt burning rubber, resulting in 3rd degree burns on top of my foot"
Naproxen was the only medication that has worked with the excruciating right leg pain due to a herniated disk. The pain would keep me up all night crying. I am now into week 4 of physical therapy I can now do all of the stretches. The only side effect I have is it did cause some stomach issues but it was worth it to not have the nerve pain. Finally seeing recovery in my future.
No more effective or longer lasting than aspirin.
"I have not found these tablets effective for the knee pain I'm having . Co codamol the strongest tablet has the same effect
I also have been having sweats so will not be taking anymore"
Prescribed 500 mg for pain in right shoulder and collar bone. Pain was about a 6 out of 10. Had no effect at all.  Regular ice and rest was the more effective than this drug.
"Had sciatica since December. I was prescribed Naproxen 500g twice a week but didn't want to take any meds. It went well but 15th May it flared up to a point I couldn't stay stand, seat, lay without excrutiating pain. I started taking pain killers I had at home when I get my period AKA Tesco's 30p and 60p:  200 Ibuprofen, Patacetamol 500, Paracetamol Extra 500 (with caffeine) and Extra Power Pain Control 500 (Parancetamol/Aspirin/Cafeine). I try to go 3 days paracetamols then 5 Ibuprofen with 1 day with no med in between. After 4 crippling weeks at home I finally managed to walk to a pharmacy to buy Naproxen. I have been taking it for a week. No relief. The Tesco meds were more effective at easing the pain. Naproxen do not work for me at all"
"I took 2 Advils without feeling any better whatsoever, I realized I needed to try something else and took 1 Aleve (Naproxen), and literally 15 minutes I was feeling much better."
"52 yr old struggled physically for 30 years, fibromyalgia, CFS, widespread joint and muscle pain.
Depressed due to daily pain and effort to do anything.
Took 500mg Naproxen and the pain, stiffness and burning has virtually gone, it took about 45 minutes to work, I feel like somebody else, woke up this morning having had a good nights sleep still feeling much better, I can't actually believe it. Ibuprofen, paracetamol didn't touch it, Zapain helps but worsens fatigue.
I was prescribed Naproxen 6 months ago 250 mg twice a day, didn't do a lot and I over read and over thought the side effects so didn't bother. I'm trying 500 mg once a day for a few days then I'll try splitting the dose. I've had no side effects on either 500mg so far, I just feel great."
"I have knee and joint ache. I use it once in a week and it gives me relief for five days.  First three days, I feel no pain anywhere in the body, then it going aching slowly and grows gradually.  If i take it regularly once in a week, I am comfortable and have no side effects felt yet."
"I'm a person where my period usually lasts around 8-10 days & is very heavy and crampy. On average I use about 6 pads a day. My period is  also super crampy where my school & my job is used to me missing almost a week. But a little over a year ago a friend of mine had a prescription for naproxen, she let me try it out to see how I liked it since nothing worked for me. I've tried advil, aleve, ibuprofen, tylenol & midol but nothing seemed to work. But let me tell you when I tried naproxen , it was a miracle!!!! it takes under 10 minutes to work for me and it has a long lasting effect. I usually take one pill a day, hardly ever two and it keeps me cramp free the entire day & thats a lot to say considering I used to miss work and school !!"
"Three weeks ago today my bad back suddenly turned in to the most excruciating thing I had ever felt and I mean the pain was serious, just to put this in perspective, I'm a 24 year old guy I've broke ribs legs and arms and just sat their laughing about it but this reduced me to a mess I literally lay on the floor in the fetal position crying. Turns out I have 2 bulges on separate discs, one of which is very bad and is pressing on my nerves causing me to loose 70% feeling in my right leg. I am now taking 2 naproxen, 2 tramadol, 2 paracetamol, 1 ondansteron, I can't really speak for the naproxen alone but as a whole they do the job, they really are making life more bearable until I can have the op"
Dizzy & severe chest pains.
"Lower back pain with muscle spasms taking naproxen plus roboxim muscle relaxer and they suck. Been in pain with no relief exempt when I went to emergency room and got 1 morphine shot, 1 tramadol shot, 3 percasets and a valium ."
"Having constant painful neck pain on both sides of my neck. 
Naproxen will help with most of the pain(tolerable-somewhat) 
But those pesky NSAIDS and their stoke/heart attack possibilities. 
If not for that little concern they would be a favorite for life. 
But seriously the naproxen really can help you for some neck pain relief. Just not to safe to use more than 10 days. I just wish my neck pain was just a ten day issue? Chronic neck pain can drain you of your life if you let it. 
But like others I wish to help people if I can with my experience with naproxen and just let people know they are not alone with their neck issues.
Good luck to all! We are going to need it."
"Had my knee pop and pain was horrid.  Could not walk; took 2 Aleve,  then there was no pain could walk much better.  Glad for such a wonderful medicine."
"Previous had this prescribed to me for Back Pain several year ago. 500mg twice a day and it certainly used to take the edge off the pain. Of course it won't eradicate the pain, it's only a mild NSAID not an opioid. Recently been using 500mg per day for a week for calf strain from running injury. Really helped in the first 48hrs. It seem there's a few comments on here regarding allergic reactions. Allergies to aspirin and other NSAID are common. If you are not allergic, then I recommend Naproxin as a starting point."
Did not relieve excruciating lower back pain from my Degenerative disc disease
Slight pain reduction. But really not worth noting. It's the colcrys that really nips it in the bud when I feel an attack coming on. I've tried the aleeve a couple times when I didn't have the other media on hand. Just didn't seem to do much. Same for any other Naproxin sodium product.
"Have taken Naproxen 750mg slow release for Psoriatic arthritis for about 2 years as daily pain relief, good efficacy but gradually diminishes over time. Still overall positive."
I have a real problem because no otc medicine works with me so I have to suffer most of the time
It's great for my frequent migraines
I have siaticia from lower lumbar to right leg all way down . been taken this just today and I can safely say it's the bees knees.  Totally fine to take and works a treat.
"I get gout flares very seldom, my last one was very painful, took naproxen for the first time it worked immediately. I love it."
Terrible heartburn and nausea after three doses(pills). Stopped on the advice of Doctor.
"First gout attack 6 mo ago.  Very painful, could barely walk.  I am 46, active all my life, 200lbs, probably drink too much.  My dad also has the disease.  On the first occurance, naproxen had little effect even at high doses as is recommended for first onset.  Went to the doctor and went to the next level--Indocin.  Time and this drug helped.  I did not alter my lifestyle.

I am currently traveling through the Dominican Republic and woke up with a sore toe.  Not nearly as painful as the first attack.  Went to the pharmacia and bought some naproxen and took a good high dose (880 mg (go big or go home)).  Two hours later, I could probably play football (soccer)...Will continue one tab (220mg) every every 6 to 8 hrs for the next couple of day"
"I took Naproxen for a week without taking Omeprazole.  The doctor had said I should only take the Omeprazole if needed. By the time I needed it , the damage had been done.  I had chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) caused by the Naproxen. You must take both at the same time. I was in agony."
"I have always had severe period cramps, fainting, nausea, and stabbing pains. Naproxen 500 has been the only (non birth control remedy) that greatly relieves my pain. It's tricky because you have to get the timing just right, not too soon before period cramps start or too late after they already started. You must start it the moment you feel cramps. Starting before your period isn't as effective because that's not how this medication works best."
"First time took two 220mg had chest pain and left arm pain lasted few days. Thought I just took to much. 5 months later another neck ache only thing with me at work those same rugby 220 naproxen. Instantaneously felt like I was having a heart attack, the following day my knees became swollen and  I couldn't walk. Three weeks later I still feel like I am having a heart attack. This product is the direct cause and the doctors have yet to figure out what it is. My chest keeps swelling up randomly, I have a one year old and a three year old and hate the thought I might die from taking one dumb pill for pain. Never again I'll just take the pain."
Cramps woke me up. Took 500 mg of Naproxen because I was out of advil. It worked in 25 minutes to eliminate all pain.
Aleve is great for back pain.I take one pill in the morning. And one at night before bed time.no pain at all.That's what my M.D. told me to take.thanks Aleve .great job
I have severe back problems. I also have arthritis.  The doctors kept giving me narcotics so I felt like a zombie all the time. and hated it.  I decided to try some Aleve.  It eased the pain enough that I can actually go out and do things I did before the back problems. No worries about being too drowsy to drive.  Not everyone can take this and you should ask your doctor before taking it.  I was an emergency room nurse for 20 years and I never had a patient with an allergic reaction to this type of medication but it can happen.  The most common side effect is stomach problems so don't take it on an empty stomach.
"I have R.A and I was skeptical at first but I was in so much pain in my wrist and hand I wanted to scream. Well I took a 250 mg Aleve and it took 2 hours to kick in but I must say thank goodness for Aleve. I still feel a small amount of discomfort but its nothing that will interfere with my day, I recommend this. Normally I take Tylenol but I think I like Aleve better. My first time taking it. Put it this way it won't hurt to try and I'm glad I did."
"Last November I was prescribed naproxen for lower back pain. After 4 days I ended up in the back of an ambulance on route to A&E. It all started with my back pain increasing, it spread up my back and across my chest. I could hardly breathe, had sharp shooting pains in my central chest area. I was discharged from A&E that afternoon and after that things got steadily worse. I ended up with serious heart palpitations, tinnitus and confusion. Have had the all clear regarding blocked arteries, no problem there. The doctors that dealt with me refuse to accept that naproxen might have been responsible, I'm now a regular attendee at the Royal London hospital, the heart failure clinic. If YOUR doctor prescribes you naproxen, remember this post."
Aleve made me itch from head to toe within 30 minutes of taking 2 pills.  It was the absolute worst experience.  The pain was more tolerable than the itch.
"I've suffered from horrible period cramps my entire life. When I was younger, I would need to be picked up from school and was bed ridden all day.  Advil has never helped reduce these cramps, in fact, it made my bleeding heavier. I started taking naproxen after my obgyn recommended it and it really does help to reduce the severity of the cramps. I still get mild cramps the first two days, but I am able to function and perform my daily activities. It works more efficiently if you take it twice a day for a few days leading to your period."
"I took 2 pills (220mg each) in the morning and it may take 1-2 hour before the pain is completely gone.  I've sciatica on my right leg from lower back down to the bottom of my feet.  Tickling & numbness besides the pain each morning.  First thing I did was taking 2 pills immediately.  I also practice yoga regularly..., I'm so grateful to discover Aleve for sciatica!   Will take it as long as my sciatica is here..."
"I take naproxen to help decrease the blood when I'm on my period taking it 3 times a day 3 days before my period and up to and it works great, I was prescribed by the doctor around a year ago and it's really been helping my periods to become lighter, since I take it for 3 days before my period I don't see any help with period pain and I never knew it could help that so my periods are still as painful as before taking naproxen"
"Was on crutches all day yesterday, painful as hell, finally out of desperation went researching for any relief from the pain. Found this site and read this forum. While still on crutches went to local Duane Read (NYC), took  some pills of Aleve at 12am and promptly passed out. Bottle states, take 2 max. 

Woke up at 4am, I can actually walk to the bathroom without crutches... it apparently took about 50% of the pain away. Still painful, still hobbling around, but I can walk unassisted! No crutches! Took another aleve pill at 4:30am and 5am, I will be loading up my pickup truck full of video gear which weighs almost 1,000lbs!

I am so glad I read this forum. Thanks guys! That really helped out!"
"Dumb doctors prescribed me this junk for a week for my damaged rotator cuff that has started to act up with medium labor and cause my whole arm to go cold and throb with pain. My hand also is going numb towards the end of the day. It did not touch my pain whatsoever. Instead it caused me to be fatigued, dizzy, raised my blood pressure, and made me feel like throwing up due to the terrible taste that lasted an hour and upset stomach that I had while the medication's effects lasted. This stuff is absolutely terrible, and so are any physicians that prescribe it. DO NOT TAKE IT. Ibuprofen lessened my pain at least a little bit with no side effects."
"Hi everyone I'm 42 I just had all my teeth pulled on Oct 6 ,2016. I was in severe pain 
Felt like my mouth was butchard I took a bottle pain relievers in two days  no help so I get a bottle of Aleve 12 hour let me tell you it stopped my pain I was so relieved so the meds said take two than 1 every 4 hours  so I bought a bottle of extra strength Tylenol and I would take the aleve every four hours and 30 minutes later I would take the 0ne Tylenol extra strength 
Works perfect today is my 4 day I feel great thanks Aleve"
"I have been taking these for last few days for back pain and had no effect on the pain.  However, I have had dreadful nausea and felt strange and depressed all week. I never feel like this and just decided to stop taking the tablets this morning to see if that made any difference.  I have been totally fine since I stopped taking these tablets.  I think people need to be careful taking these tablets as the side effects can really wreck your head and stomach."
"Took Naproxen 500mg twice a day for four days, then ended up in an ambulance on-route to A&E department. 

Naproxen also gave me a serious heart problem, I now attend the heart failure clinic, and the ENT department for tinnitus. I am a UK citizen based in the UK.
I regret taking them."
"I have a Anterior labral tear Instant pain relief soon after the first dose (500mg twice daily) use codeine as a breakthrough medication  in case it gets more severe but other than that, highly recommended pain relief as an alternative to opioid medication "
"Two days ago I was getting out of my car . I slipped on the gravel, twisting and slipping the lower discs in my back. For two days I haven't been able to move without excruciating pain . I have been crying for two days I've taken Advil, Tylenol, Motrin muscle relaxers. Just a few hours ago my friend cones over hands me two aleves and some warm water. Within 30minutes I'm not lying the pain is gone. Thank you aleve, i promise to pass the word of your greatness."
"I get gout in both big toe joints a couple of times per year and have always been to busy to go to the Doctor.
I started off having tablets from friends who suffer from gout and tried a few different types that they had been prescribed and always kept on stand-by! The best one I've found (and I've suffered for several years now) was Naproxen. My friends would give me a few pills and they would relieve it every time. Some other NSAIDs did not work at all.
After doing a bit of research I discovered that Naproxen is a prescription drug. However, it is contained in Feminax Ultra which is sold over the counter for period pain only. I always keep a pack near me and take 4 pills as soon as I feel it starting. Works every time."
"Gives me noticeable stomach pain on occasion and I only take when I am desperate due to the risk of it causing stomach ulcers/intestinal bleeding in otherwise healthy people. 
It works very well to stop joint and menstrual pain though and also relaxes my joints and gives greater flexibility."
"Save your money. Might as well take a baby aspirin. Extra strength Advil Liquid Gels, or Tylenol Arthritis work 10 times better."
"Currently taking prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice daily for severe lower back pain. I feel a small amount of relief for a 2 hours and then my back pain is in full force. I felt nauseous and i did eat 20 minutes before taking this medicine, There has to be a better way!"
"I had an acute gout attack in my big toe which was extremely painful and started right away with very high doses of Ibuprofen. After 3 days there was little to no change, still very painful, not able to walk and red and swollen. I read about Naproxen on this page and - living in the UK - it is only available in the format of Feminax, which are tablets for period pain relief. Having nothing to lose, I went ahead and bought a pack. I started at 8am with 2 pills (500 mg) which started to relief the pain about 2 hours later. I took the third pill (250 mg) at 4pm. By 7pm I could feel no pain at all. At midnight I took the next pill (8 hours later, again 250 mg) and when I woke up at 7 I had no symptoms left. What a great pill."
"I'm 40 and have been a long life sufferer of migraines especially 3/4 days before my period. My migraines would last 4/5 days with the first day not able to function at all. I will be looking for a cool, dark and quite room to lay my body in and not to speak.. Since I was prescribed Naproxen 250 mg, I started taking 2 just as I start feeling a tingle of it coming. It doesn't stop it all together, but it eases it. It made my life a lot better. I get a lot less episodes of migraine that don't last long. I also made a change in my life style. I make sure I avoid stress when I can, I do take at least a day when I don't do anything but chill, not even housework. My diet has always been very healthy and balanced so I know it's not it's not that."
"Aleve is much more effective for me than Advil.  Like everyone else I've been dealing with extremely painful cramps my whole life.  I was taking Advil but would always end up throwing up and bent over in excruciating pain, switched to Aleve and at least now I can function during the first three critical days and not stuck in bed throwing up.  I still get bad cramps every now and then so it's not perfect but at least Aleve helps me get through it.  I usually take two in the morning; two at night. There should be a support group for woman that suffer from severe menstrual cycles. I feel like I'm the only one, but felt better after reading some of the other posts here; I'm not alone in my struggle."
"I am having severe pain on my right shoulder, radiating to my elbow, and a numbed index finger.  I was prescribed 500 mg of naproxen twice daily.  It is woefully inadequate.  I have been supplementing with tylenol but that still isn't cutting it.  This is nof a drug that works for me."
"I have very painful cramps, nausea, vomiting, the whole works. When I was younger, I'd have to come home early from school because I took the Advil too late, or was scared to take it at all for fear it would make the pain worse or wouldn't work at all. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. This is the case with all other pain medications I've tried to lessen my period pain. As for my 375 mg, prescription Naproxen, I can say that it worked fabulously the first time I used it. But today is the third time (month) I've used it and I'm in not-to-be-snuffed-at pain. I'm getting by with applied heat. I'm at a loss for what I should do this month and the next month and the next."
"I used to just take ibuprofen and that would only take the edge off but I will still be in a lot of pain that I have vomited before and had to go home from work. Then I tried taking ibuprofen and paracetamol at the same time, 2 of each every 4 hours which was better but I could still feel the pain. Then someone suggested I try Naproxen and it has honestly changed my life. Now I only need to take 2 the first time and then 1 every 6-8 hours and I am almost totally pain free. I'm just kicking myself I didn't try it 10 years ago. I'm Australian so I just buy it over the counter and it about $20 for a packet."
Not as good as THC but very effective for me. One wants a solution that allows your mind to not constantly be aware of pain. This does the job for me.
"Had tennis elbow started taking napoxen the pain started to gradually decrease after a couple of days ,i also felt very tierd and not much energy falling asleep in the day .I stoped taking then ,i really drained me ."
"I really love naproxen and taking it. It is really effective especially with the fact that I get such strong cramps that usually keep me in bed all day. It lets me enjoy activities without worrying about pain and how to make myself feel better. Sometimes my cramps may get so strong that I can feel cramps through it but its almost not so strong but occasionally strong. Naproxen just depends on the amount of pain you get and its always a mystery for me because i can never predict my cramps. But the point is, Naproxen always makes me feel better no matter how strong my cramps are. I recommend people to take it for ease of pain and always use it with food, trust me. I didn't once and it took away the cramps but i got such a weird stomach ache."
Aleve is the only pain killer that really helps. I used to take a double dose of extra strong Midol and it would last me maybe 4 hours. With the Aleve I take 1 every 11-12 hours and I am good for the day.
It does help a bit on stiffness and swelling. Please be sure to drink plenty of water as it can rise your creatine levels and lead to kidney problems if you don't stay hydrated.
"I'm gonna be honest Naproxen does not help at all for my cramps. I got a IUD to help with the pain a flow of my menstrual cycle, it helped with the flow but not the pain. She prescribe this to me and I still have excruciating pain. Everyone is different"
"Was originally given naproxen for dental pain. but didnt use it all, I read leaflet and saw it helps nerve pain as my sciatica flared up again now lasting ten weeks onwards. I took one yesterday and one today and its eased quite a bit. My worse time is when I get up am hobbling around on one leg until nerve settles. still get the pins needles in foot and leg, but the naproxin seems to ease the actual pain and relax the nerves. It does not make the pain go but just relaxes it. It works for some and not for others but guess same with all medicines. I have tried to manage without pain killers and didnt want to end up reliant on them. but its that or having severe pain 24.7. London Uk dont pay for meds covered via other conditions."
"Post operational sciatica after pelvic. Floor repair
I have been taking two 500mg tablet twice daily.
It has been marvellous can barely feel any pain.
I take warfarin so really careful to take 20mgs of omprazole
in the morning. No side effects after two days. First time that I have taken 
Naproxen .I hope if ever I need this type of relief that my GP will
Prescribe again. Cannot praise enough."
"I was given this by the A&E Dept for multiple knee ligament rupture. Within an hour of taking: extreme vertigo, nausea, sweats, vomiting, diarrhoea and disorientation. Symptoms last for days. Don't risk it.  Just take something else."
Have some serious side effects. Please google a little bit before using. In my case i had upset stomach. Stopped after 3 days of use
"I'm a 31 y/o male, had a knee replacement 3 months before my last birthday. I use naproxen to manage daily pain. Works great. At least I can still poop with these in my system! If it gets too bad I also use aspercreme with lidocaine. Miracle combination."
Aleve worked great for my big toe gout. The trick is in the right dose for your situation. Woke up at 2am with burning pain in my big toe. Took 550mg of Aleve and was back to sleep in about 1 hour. Went to 220mg 3x day and feel 95% better. Keep it on hand. You won't be sorry. Oh! And no side effects.
"I had a severe side-effect of naproxen. I had some inflammation in my left knee and it was bothering me with sitting down, so I showed it to the doctor. I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice a day for 5 days. I took three tables in 36 hours (making sure after lunch and dinner and with plenty of water) and after taking second pill on the fist day, I had terrible time. I couldn't sleep, have severe funny feeling in my stomach, right under my ribs and just above the stomach. I had strong empty-stomach feeling all the time. The feel for my whole body was terrible and I feel super-sick. I didn't throw up or had loose-motions but had lots of stomach pain and extreme heart-burn. 

I stopped taking medicine after 3 pills and informed my doctor."
I took this medicine for GOUT just prior to a holiday. It reduced the pain of the gout but made my legs feel as if they were made of lead! I did not continue after 3 or 4 tablets as they were affecting my ability to walk successfully.
I have been using this for about a week now and it has completely changed my life.  I am more or less free of pain. The side effects are a little worrying but as long as you watch out for these it should be ok.  I am now able to go to work and actually function without being in pain.  For me it is working.
"Been having severe menstrual cramps since I began menstruation. I tried Naproxen (prescribed) in the past and it worked very well. Now, it has no effect what so ever. So far, liquid ibuprofen has been the only thing that helps make the pain manageable."
Suffer from severe headache and usually no medicine works- but by chance on holiday I had one of these that belongs to my mum and I couldn't believe how quickly it disappeared as soon as I feel a migraine coming on I take naproxen now and it goes quickly
Third month on naproxen and can't believe how much it has changed my life.  I use to suffer with migraines and tension headaches a week before my period lasting throughout my period leaving me in incruciating pain since taking naproxen my headache pain has reduced by 80%
"Dear Aleve,
Your packaging is a total fail. I had to take the pliers to the bottle to get into it (it's very accommodating now) then had to take my contacts out and hunt out some reading glasses to see how many pills to take for a dose.

The newly swallowed pills have not yet worked on the pain, so I have no way of deciding - at this point - if your product is worth the bother."
Had been on prescription strength Naproxen for 6 days before I decided I didn't feel a benefit. Took nothing for 2 days and then bought Aleve 220 mg per pill and took 2. Not sure what the difference was but have noticed more relief from the constant discomfort while walking.
"Took two OTC. While it took the edge off the most extreme pain, was still very uncomfortable. I have a very high pain tolerance as I was a professional dancer, and martial artist. What annoys me is that you can't take anymore for 12 hours. Severe pain started coming back after 8 hours. I'd rather go back to my 4-5 Advil every 4 hours than this."
Been on straight codeine 7 years 12 daily just came a habit. In the end til today I crunched up bad enuough to almost drop my 3month old baby...hubby had to come home from work practically lift me in the car to the docs...ended up gtn a cordisone injection plus norflex and naproxen omg am so relaxed right now first time in years.
"I have been suffering acute pain (on scale 1-10 stays between 7-10)  due to a fibrolipoma in my lower lumbar. Seems likely I have something called Tethered Cord Syndrome. Was put on naproxen by one doctor and after taking it for a few years was sick of the way it made me feel so I stopped taking it. Noticed that when not taking it I felt just as much pain as when I was taking it, so it was not helping AT ALL. Everyone needs to know that naproxen only works for pain caused by inflammation, it will do nothing for nerve damage, in my experience."
"Works great for menstrual pain and doesn't hurt my stomach like other naproxen, as long as I take it on a full stomach. I take one and it works all day. Only draw back is the cost, so my doctor stocked me up on samples. Even with insurance it was outrageous."
I strained my neck I'm 30. This thing gave me chest pains super weakness its scary. Never again
I for one have horrible period cramps I have tried so many over-the-counter pain relievers and none of them worked then I tried naproxen and it changed my life I was actually able to get up and go outside and do my work I highly recommend it it's a great lifesaver if you have severe cramps like I do I have severe cramps to the point where I'm on the floor crying and almost vomiting and naproxen has held it back I mean help the pain back quite a bit love it. Its great and you don't need a perscription.
"Bicep tendon rupture from weight lifting. I was prescribed over the counter Aleve which is basically Naproxen twice daily for 2 weeks, then once daily for two weeks. I experienced immediate pain relief. I'm now on my third week at once a day and feels great with no side effects. Definitely on the mend. Not much into taking any kind of meds or drugs but sometimes we need them to help us recover. I highly recommend this over any other pain reliever as it is an anti inflammatory as well which this injury needs."
"I had really bad cramps. I tried several things, and nothing seem to work. When I get them bad I have  to miss school and just lay in my bed with  back pain, headache, barf etc. So I had enough and decided to go to the doctors. My doctors prescribe me for naproxen. On the day of my cycle I took the pill and in about 30 minutes I was pain free. I took a nap and it felt like I didn't even have my period! I definitely recommend this, I am very pleased and this will be my go to every month. but remember, what works for me doesn't work for all."
"Severe jumpy left leg
Itching left leg"
I've been prescribed it off and on over the last 9 years and it didn't change my pain at all!!!! Ibuprofen works way better then naproxen. Naproxen was like taking a pill that was made of NOTHING!!!!!
"injured my trap muscle and was in considerable pain....tried flexeril, diclofenac, motrin, heat cold, etc,,,,,the only thin that helped was aleve.....thankfully"
"Allergic reaction to Anaprox, this is poison I do not understand how the FDA approved this medication that almost kill me. I do not recommend it because of the dangerous side effects and should be taken out of the market. IT IS POISON AND I ONLY TOOK ONE 559 MG IN THE GENERIC FORM ( NAPROXEN )"
"Started with constant diarrhoea after taking Naproxen for 4weeks. Had a Colonoscopy and samples taken showed early stages of Microscopic Colitis,  Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Not happy."
Was not happy with result initially as I was following dosage on label. After switching to dosage recommendation found here and elsewhere the change was almost immediate and greatly improved. I get attacks averaging once a year usually brought on during weight loss when I don't keep up with the amount of recommended liquids.
"Well I went to the ER, they diagnosed me with gout. They gave me a prescription that was $45 for 20 pills! Pharmacist told about Aleve. I bought it for $7.99/100 pills. Best choice ever, no regrets"
I took aleve during a gout attack. I could not really say that it helped my swelling or the pain. I ended up taking some advil to relieve the pain.
"I had terrible ear pain because of wax blockage. Could not sleep. 

Doc prescribed this piece of brilliance and.. Bam... The pain was gone!!!! 

Fantastic pills."
After 3 years on naprosyn 500 one a day I started to get irritable anxious finding fault all the time about stupid things. As soon as I stopped I was normal again .  I don't know what tablet to take now as I am very sensitive to a lot of drugs.
"I have a torn shoulder tendon (rotator cuff injury) which has been causing me agonising pain 24/7 for 6 months. Ibuprofen wasn't working so I was given Naproxen. It takes quite a while to get to work (up to an hour to kick in) but once it works the relief is amazing. Only thing is, once it wears off (about 4-6 hours), the pain returns big time, and you're not supposed to use more than 2 tablets a day. Also, it made me ravenously hungry at the start (not so much now) so I've added a couple of Kg in weight. When it doesn't work well I take some Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) as well. Doesn't do anything for my headaches though and may even cause them."
"Girls... If you want to be able to function and actually get out of bed this is the solution for you. I have unbearable cramps to where I'm stuck in bed and cry all day from the pain. I've tried everything over the counter and nothing has worked. I was prescribed the 550 mg and my life has changed. Even though there are times where I still have pain it's not as bad as it was. I don't experience any real side effects except sometimes I get a little tired, but it's not horrible."
Doctor prescribed me naproxen sodium since I have endometriosis and it helps my cramps a lot.  My cramps before were so bad they made me stay in bed and made me nauseous. This stops/slows the cramps thus eliminating all my other period pains. Definitely recommend this to other women with the same problem.
"For the very first time EVER  a medication worked for my migraine. My carrier would not cover the originally prescribed medication, so dr ordered naproxen and sumatriptan. I took it , not expecting much but I was wrong. My migraine felt like day 3 of a migraine. I could not believe it. I have had migraines for over 30 yrs and nothing has ever ever made any difference. I carry them both with me everywhere!"
"Didn't help at all, it did give me terrible heart burn though."
"I have severe scoliosis so my pain is pretty strong most days. My doctor recommended Aleve so I take 2 caplets (440mg) and there is a bit less pain for a few hours. The package says it works for 8-12 hours, but I'm lucky if it stretches out to 5. Takes my pain from a 7 (out of 10) to a 3 or 4. And then I can't drink for another 8 hours which is no fun."
"I had been suffering with sciatica for a number of years, when it suddenly worsened.  I started getting shooting pains and severe weakness in both of my legs.  After one dose of 500mg I was able to sit comfortably and walk without the worry of one of my legs giving out from under me"
"Nursing student on feet all day, lifting patients. This is the only drug that helps my SI back and hip pain. I keep it with me daily. I would seriously be in trouble with out it."
"Costochondritis following bronchitis infection, taking naproxen for three months no change,"
"Naproxen helped to lessen the pain of herniated discs, but I experienced shortness of breath and was only able to get through 10 mins of cardio class. Before Naproxen I would complete 60 - 90 mins of cardio. I stopped the drug immediately, that was 6 months ago and I still have shortness of breath and can't do cardio class at all. this drug should be pulled from the market."
It does absolutely nothing for my pain.
"Aleve heavily advertised for 12 hour pain relief.  Also recommended by a friend.  Tried as desperate for all day pain relief from sciatic nerve.  No effect whatsoever, persevered for a week, no relief, even with recommended stretching."
This medicine made a great difference overnight for me.
"I have been taking naproxen on and off for years.Usually for back pain.It is the best treatment I have received .After 3 weeks of sciatica I started taking it again.This time it has helped,but I have a funny taste in my mouth and my mouth feels sore,my lips are slightly swollen as well.I will leave it off for a while and see if it feels better. I  have anaphylaxis if I eat gelatine, does anyone know if it contains any?."
"This should be the first thing you take when you realize you have back pain. At the very least this will take the sharp edge off and give you enough time to get to Urgent Care or an immediate doctor appointment. I have noticed that for extended use (2-5 days) the pain symptoms slowly come back, but at least this is something I can buy OTC."
"I was suffering from the common cold and had symptoms of dry cough, congested sinus, large headache, slight ear pain, sore throat, and muscle pain in my knees and gleutus maximus. I couldn't eat anything either and at times felt like vomiting. Also, I would wake up in the middle of sleeping, mumbling from my symptoms and pain. And, I would sleep long hours, and no sleep is enough for me. Taking naproxen 220 mg and sleeping that night, I felt 10 times better. The headache was gone, and so was the muscle pain. I slept good that night. I feel like I could do the usual tasks (including eating) now."
You can't take with GERD
Female 20 years old - I recently started a new job as a cashier. I started to experience pain after having to pick up heavy packs of water bottles and other heavy items. The pain was all in my lower back. I went to visit my chiropractor and that would alleviate the pain until I went back to work. I would rate my pain on a scale from 1 to 10; a 7. It was a sharp stabbing pulling pain in my lower back and it even hurt to take a deep breath. Today was the first day I took Aleve when I went to work and my back pain was almost completely gone. I was able to move around without being uncomfortable. I am extremely satisfied with the results.
"I have tendonitis in both elbows and ankles I am young and fit very active person a few months ago I could barely walk or hold a cup of water to my mouth without being in consent pain, I pushed through as much as I could but one day it got too much I went to my doctor who prescribed me 500mg Naproxen and instantly the pain has gone, I am back running and at the gym doing weights. I have had no side effects."
This is my go to drug every month for cramps. Love love love.  I've had severe cramps ever since and as soon as I started taking this everything will go away in less than 15 minutes.
I can tell it's working! When ever I take the medication my pain reduces from like a 6 to a 4 which is awesome!!
yes I find this drug ok for my condition. Thankfully I haven't experienced any side effects at moment. I have lost weight and pain has been reduced.
"I have been using this drug for 2 years now. Every time I feel like I am starting a migraine, I take one pill and it kills it in no time. I have not gotten a single episode of migraine since I started to take this pill. It is magical. I used to have really bad migraines that made me vomit."
"I was proscribed 500mg tablets to help with a sprained lumbar. The pharmacist told me that at worst i would experience indigestion, and it should not be combined with other pain medication or else I'd deal with internal bleeding. What i wasn't ready for was crippling fatigue, vision impairment, nausea, urine darkening, cold sweats, and my back pain getting even worse. I looked up the side effects that the pharmacist didn't mention and found then listed under the Uncommon and Rare side effects, which means I'm just unlucky."
"I take naproxen for jaw pain and it's really hit-or-miss. Sometimes it works like a charm, but other times it'll do absolutely nothing. It fails more often than it helps, though."
"I started taking this per my Doctor instead of Tylenol for lower back pain.  I had stomach issues.. could not eat, vomited, severe itching on the legs and armsI "
Don't feel any difference with this medication 2 tablets 1 in morning 1 at night doesn't work for me at all 250mg
Suffered severe period pain doctor put me on naproxen in 2 months have no pain and no period flow it's basically stopped but side effects I got itchy hives but it's great..but doctor says pain is fibroids that have to come out I wanted to stay on naproxen but she said it's only a solution not the end result....
"I am pretty sure this medication is just acid in pill form. And not the fun kind either. No. I took this medication for severe arthritis and fybromialgia and 15 minutes later my whole esophogus feels like it's on fire. I took the medication with food as prescribed and still this is the worst heartburn I have ever had in my life. I used to have severe ulcers, and I know when a medication is burning my stomach lining. No sir. No more ulcers for me thank you.
I also had the alarming sensation of hearing everything while under water. I spent the whole week asking people to repeat themselves because their voices sounded muffled. That with severe ringing in the ears and persistent nausea-I quit this medication after a week."
Made me depressed and out of it to the point I had brain fog and was hospitalized
"Male - 33years old. Excruciating pain in lower SI region of my back following an aggressive 30 mile bick ride and a few days of surfing. Woke up the next morning with shooting pain in low back which progressed to shooting pains running down my glutes and referred pain to the hip flexor region. For two weeks this was extremely painful and did not subside even w/ ice applications and finally chiropractic visits 5 total and lots of Advil. 

Per the suggestion of my wife I tried aleve (2 pills for first dose and 1 pill each dose after that. After 2 pills I noticed a HUGE difference and significantly reduced pain as well as better range of motion as inflammation had gone down. I highly recommend for anyone with back pain as it really helped me!"
I have been suffering from back and shoulder pain non stop for 8 months now. Was prescribed narcotics which made me feel horrible. Took naproxen before bed and I had the best night sleep I've had in about a year. Worked great for me!
I went for a walkabout in Australia wearing inappropriate footwear and developed tendonitis on my right heal. I was told by the doctor to stick to over the counter pain killers but none of them worked over a 4 week period. When I returned to the UK my doctor prescribed 500 Naproxen and 15 mg Lansoprazole Gastro-Resistant capsules. After 2 doses the month long pain subsided and I had no side effects. This medicine relaxed the tight tendon within a day. The problem has not returned so I can keep dancing. Great medicine.
"I've had sciatica pain for the past few days. Tried Tylenol 3, Advil and regular Tylenol with codeine. Nothing worked so I tried Aleve. Took 1 the first day and didn't feel a difference at all. Got brave and took 2 today, even though these are supposed to last 12 hours and it didn't feel any different. Personally speaking this medicine is a waste of money and doesn't work at all.  This is a medicine that works especially on muscle pain and I felt no difference period. I do not recommend this to anyone. Go to your doctor and get something prescribed."
"I have chronic pain and tendinitis in my ankles, knees, shoulders, and elbows. I've played competitive softball and basketball my whole life and now play for my high school. Without naproxen it usually hurts so bad I can't play at all but I take 3 of them at once and it usually takes care of most of the pain. There is still some pain left but it usually helps significantly. I just wish you could take more than one dose a day because I usually need a second one"
"Swollen and red lower legs, swollen eyelids.
Doctor prescribed Naproxen Apo. After couple of uses, swelling was reduced, but got severe stomach cramps. I stopped using it after the second use, yet it bother me day and night for week now. Still experiencing pain in joints, swelling and now the stomach ache."
"Was prescribed drug for Achilles tenditis, 500mg Naproxen twice a day with omeprazole 20 mg.  Should never have taken this as caused heartburn and stomach infection, stopped taking on second day and still have not recovered from stomach problems over 2 months later despite taking other remedies.  Disgusting drug!!!"
"You have got to catch the attack in the early stages ,750mg to start and 250 every 8 hours. Mind you I get a really bad stomach with the 750mg dose but it realy does the trick"
"like the previous person mention, I'm a strong believer of aleve, it works faster for my gout than the prescription meds I take. No more going to the doctor for refills.....Aleve works!"
Naproxen is the only thing that will make my gout subside when I have an attack.
I took two aleve and my back pain hasn't even lessened. Still hurts the same after 4 hours and it's supposed to work for 8-12 hours.
Took this for a pain I have in my wrist. Don't have arthiritis. I'm 15. It's supposed to stop the swelling and pain on the palm of my hand but it's done nothing except give me all the possible side effects. It's affecting my daily routines so yeah. Not good at all really. It's a 0/10
"Wow has this changed my life. I was a long time sufferer of migraines and headaches. Advil and tynelols are like candy to me now and don't do a thing to relief pain. Even heavy prescribed migraine drugs by my doctor did not work as much as Aleve does! It is simply, for my part, miraculous! It works 99.9% of the time. It works to prevent a headache when I feel it coming. It also works to break the headache or migraine when it is already ongoing and painful. And most of the time, a single pill works. I have to say I really hope my body doesn't come used to Aleve and therefore making it less effective. So far, after a little more than a year taking Aleve, it still is perfectly effective in my case. Don't hesitate to try!"
I have taking naproxen 500mg for migraine it alleviated a lil bit of the pain. But I did not see full recovery but it worked for my 14yr old son it took  his headache away.
"I've had spinal stenosis in my lumbar area with resultant localized and sciatic pain for over thirty years now (just turned 70...decided I was getting to be way too old to be a junkie...got addicted to opiates 25 years ago). After the VA helped me through opiate-replacement therapy, I got off even the Suboxone two months ago. Clean the first time in 30 years. 

I take Naproxen as needed, but think I need to be on a regular daily twice-a-day dose of 500mg Naproxen to keep the low back pain down.
I must be a real wuss! I read all the entries above about people nearly vomiting or passing out from the pain! My own pain is nowhere NEAR that level but I HATE pain of any kind, so try to avoid even aching low back. Naproxen helps."
"I was prescribed this to help with an inflamed joint in my foot.  Historically, I had taken Aleve, but didn't like the drug because I felt it didn't really work.  Last time I took it, it work in the 11th hour of 12 hurt effectiveness time range and was gone by hour 12. But the doctor insisted I take it this time.  I took it for a little more than a week and on the 10th day, I woke up to horrible chest pains.  I'm 36 years old and don't believe I have a heart condition.  I stopped taking the pills and the pain in my chest lessened towards the end of the day.  However, my blood pressure was through the roof, when I'm characteristically low, and my resting pulse rate was 114.  I also spiked a fever in the same day.  
Days later, still symptoms"
"I take Naproxen when my knees hurt from arthritis, but I have to take it every day for at least  3 days for the pain to go away. Now my Dr. doesn't want me to Naproxen any longer, he said it's not good for  people 65 to take it, I want to find out why?"
"I took Alieve for a week and a half. It worked great on my chronic back and foot pain, however my arms and finger joints began to hurt like arthritis! I've never taken a drug which causes new pain!  "
"I pulled a muscle in my back on a Saturday. The pain was intense. Sleepless nights because of the pain. I started taking paracetamol and ibuprofen which did help during the day time. But once you have a sleep waking up was painful.
Saw a doctor today. Now Friday. They told me to get naproxen 500mg. Take 1 twice a day. Took one as soon as I got home. Seem to work. Put still had the pain. Slightly. Took 1 before bed time.  Only to awake in pain. I will continue using them as described by my GP but now using paracetamol to. Anti-inflammatory maybe but not a pain killer."
"Was prescribed this for my crippling period cramps that made it impossible for me to go about my day whatsoever. It worked well for the first few months. It did not completely eliminate my pain but the pain was not nearly as bad as before. After about 4 months of taking it I began to notice side effects such as racing heart beat, difficulty swallowing, and constipation among others. I quickly stopped taking it after noticing these side effects."
Sciatica  almost stop me from my passion. Dancing has been my life's dream. Taking 1 or 2 Naprosyn has helped me so much. Even after reading all the side affects I was scared to take  it but the pain was unbearable.  After taking 3 different meds  this is the one that works for me
Prescribed 750mg per day for horrendous sciatica - the effect was no better than taking smarties. 5 months later MRI scan has confirmed it was in fact a herniated disc. I ended up on 240mg per day of codeine and eventually ended up on amitriptyline too to treat 10 days and nights of extortionate pain. 5 months later don't experience a lot of pain but still have numbness in foot and difficulty walking
When I first started using naproxen for migraines it really worked quickly and fast but now I take it and it does not work at all..
I had never hard of naproxen sodium before but I had a bad headache at work and my friend gave it to me.  It worked well and fast.  I would definitely take it again.
Middle Back Pain and knee Pain . Yeah work for sure but need too double the daily usage
"My head and base of the neck started hurting three days ago.  The pain also moved from place to place and so abnormal that I scheduled a doctor's appointment...for next week. This pain even made my hair hurt.  Felt like spots in the central back part of my head had been bruised and again, the pain location changed from the back center of head to my upper neck to the back of ears and then to the top.  Prescription pain medicine left over from a surgery didn't help.  Last night I took 3 Aleve out of desperation.  Fell asleep and woke up a few hours later feeling much, much better.  Will still see my doctor but won't be a crazy person by the time I get there."
"Swelling, tingling feeling on my tongue and hives shortly after taking this product. I remember taking it for period pain in middle school and had little issues, now I must stay completely away from it."
I'd had sciatica for 6 weeks before doctor prescribe naproxen 250mg twice a day have been taking for two weeks cant say much relief for things like walking but a little for when at rest and can now at least sleep on affected side
"I have tried everything but only with this painkiller I can function on first day of my period. I still feel little pain but bearable. I can go to job. Until I discover this drug I was every month minimum one day in bed vomiting, screaming and crying. Other pills never helped this much."
"I was passing out from the sheer pain that radiated from my lower abdomen to my lower back and so on. I had quite the pain tolerance, yet this pain was like no other. Hot water bottles, home remedies, Motrin, nothing worked. When I spoke to my doctor, she recommended the pill but my mother was against this because of my age. After I turned 13, my doctor decided to prescribe me naproxen, 250 mg, take 2 at onset of cramps and then 1 pill every 6-8 hours as needed. It was magical, I mean within 10-20 minutes of me taking it, the pain went away. How? Naproxen is a NSAID, it reduces inflammation in the uterus. That simple. Highly recommend, but use carefully so as to not damage your liver. Seriously."
I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg for my bursitis behind my knees in both legs. I am a college athlete and was having many problems performing at the necessary level with the pain in my legs--Naproxen helped immensely. Felt very nauseous if I did not take this medication on a full stomach!
"I love Aleve!  I've been lifting weights for more than 20 years and started having tendonitis in my elbows a few years ago.  Often times all I'd have to do is take Aleve and rest for a day or two and the pain would go away.  This time I'm having to lay off the heavy weights (for good) and wear the brace, but use Aleve as well.  The combination of the two is really working!  I started out taking it twice a day, but have gone down to once a day.  I plan to do that for a week or two."
I've always had horrible cramps which where unbearable I used Advil but I always end up taking 6+ so then my doctor prescribed Naproxens 500mg and only take 2 a day and the pain totally goes always within the first 10 minutes
I have had costochondritis for two months now. I have found that my body best responds to naproxen and toradol/ ketorolac. These have both been prescribed to me after my success with Flanax (Naproxen).
"Actively particepated in physical activities in Army long service. During that time didn't have any ortho problems. little crossing over 60 yrs age I noticed pain with cracking sound in my Rt knee in regular brisk walking. The pain was not subsided with various topical creams from Homoeopath as well as Allopathic NSAIDS.Instead,severely suffered with agrevatred pain in knee and stiffness in ankle Jt in same leg. One day I came accross prominent action of NAPROXEN in OA.Following 500 mgs BD after meals for fortnight, the neproxen proved to be excellent and brushed aside all other subtitutes. It has rejuvenated my previous strength in carrying out day today works. No side affects observed."
"I don't know what I did but whenever I jumped on the trampoline with my kids, I was experiencing some weird pain in my upper back.  I put some a535 on my back. That didn't help. The next day it still hurt!! Then I took two aleve pills and the next morning I was ok. And I continued this way for a few days and my back was all better!!! Thanks aleve! "
"I've taken two doses of Naproven 500mg,, one yesterday evening and one this morning. I've had no side effects but no pain relief either. I'm getting depressed with having to put up with this debilitating pain."
"Works well in the long term, not for immediate pain relief."
Very little relief.  I finished PT and after a year it still wasn't great.  Due to other issues a physician switched me to Diflofenac Sodium (Voltarin?) which has been a wonderful.  It takes away all my joint issues.
I tired Aleve. It works to some extent for a few hours but it stops. I get better and longer lasting results with Advil liqui-gels for arthritis.
"Taking for All over pain and arthritis from car crash. After suffering for 14 years of spine knee neck and wrist pain I was on tramadol and Co-codamol but was bedridden nearly everyday, Nhs changed me onto naproxen and I could potter about doing housework after three doses of 500mg with Co-codamol. I couldn't believe the difference after all the years of suffering! Hopefully get back to the old me in no time. Looking forward to all the ups and not so many downs."
"If you have any kind of stomach problems, these kind of medications aren't for you. It only relieved about 10-20% of my pain & hurt my stomach in the process."
"I've been diagnosed with costochondritis for 2 yrs now. I have other joint issues, along with military neck and tendinitis. Nothing has worked as well and effectively as Aleve. I take anywhere from 220-500mg when needed. All my aches and pains subside and I can move about freely. Even with nerve damage. I am so thankful for Aleve!"
"I was introduced to naproxen sodium a couple years ago and it worked great for muscle pain. However, recently I took some for neck pain and instantly went into severe anafelactic shock. While on the highway, luckily my fianc"
"Have bulging disc at l-1 ,spinal stenosis at t-10-11 ,c-6-7,didn't  want to take narcotics. Have been taking Aleve for 7 days, excellent relief. Hope it lasts."
I was taking this 2x a day at 500 mg for a torn pcl knee injury. Has not done anything for the pain!
"Wow! Before taking this I couldn't even touch my foot, now I am 95% pain free! Brilliant!"
"I have chronic shoulder pain for over a year. I finally got it checked out and was prescribed this. It works wonders, but makes me very nauseated. I really wish I didn't get like that."
Works better after taking it a couple of days
Best one out there.
It works better than Vicodin for my lower back pain. It takes about 45 minutes to kick in.
"My period has been awful since the first time I got it at age 13. I've experienced a variety of symptoms each month that make my period unpredictable. Some months I feel fine and maybe just get a pimple, other months I'm a crying mess, there have been times where the pressure on my lower back and abdomen is so intense that I cant move, nausea, headaches, joint pain in my knees, etc. It got to the point where when I was 15 I started birth control. The birth control made me extremely emotional so I stopped and continued with Advil, Midol, I tried bananas, warm compresses, exercise. Nothing worked. I started using naproxen and within 10-15 min my symptoms are alleviated and I can go about my day."
Caused severe itching and hives.
"I have been suffering from back pain for many years, mainly due to heavy contact sports and work related lifting, and lately find it difficult to walk for long distances without being doubled over in pain. I would struggle to stand up from a sitting position. The pain would go down my legs and into my abdominal region, and have been trying all different kinds of treatment from gels to moderate pain killers all with different degrees of success, but none that actually took the pain away completely, and not for any length of time. I was eventually prescribed Naproxen and in less than a day I felt a different person. The pain has gone completely from everywhere. It's a new lease of life and can look forward to doing things again pain free."
"I was prescribed 500mg a day for a shoulder injury, I am so used to dealing with terrible period pain and extremely heavy flow that it wasn't the reason I went to see a doctor. Not only does it help with my shoulder pain but my period has completely turned around into an experience I do not dread and worry about. I am so grateful to have been prescribed it. I don't have to put my life on hold to hide at home in pain and all around feeling terrible. When I started getting my period until I graduated high school I would always end up missing a day or two because of how much pain I was in and how heavy my flow was. When I worked I would dread the days with it and a lot of the time miss work because of it."
I've been using this medicine on & off for 25 years. I get muscle spasms every few years & virtually drop to the floor with pain. 2 to 3 days with this stuff & I'm back swinging again. Better than Forte or Voltaren by a long shot.
I have extreme nausea a few days before and during my period. I tried so many things but nothing worked. My gyn wrote me a script for 550 mg of naproxen twice daily and I took it 3 days before my period and during my period. It worked!! I feel 100% better than the previous month.
Menstrual cramps
Toothache- took the pain away instantly. Very good for a toothache.
"Have been suffering from acute gout attacks for about 6 years.  Usually 1 attack per year that requires me to stay off my feet for a day or 2.  I have taken Indomethacin,  Colchicine and Colcrys with varying degrees of relief and started Allopurinol about 3 months ago.  In all my research over the years, I never reviewed Naproxen.  The last attack happened about a week ago and I cycled through my last few Colcrys with barely any relief.  A trip to Walgreens for Aleve liquigels and about 2 hours later I had ~70% reduction in pain.  I've been managing it with a scheduled dose for a few days now and the pain is nearly gone.  Still some swelling, but getting better each day.  This regimen has been more effective than any prescription medication."
"I have used most of the narcotics on the list, and now that I live in Florida it is almost impossible to get a Doctor to prescribe anything other than Aspirin.  Aspirin now has caused my stomach to act up due to ulcers so now I also need to take Prilosec 40 mg.  So far this is the best of these medicines on the list."
"For over the past year and half I have experienced up and down painful levels of  a combination of left knee pain, extreme left tight hamstrings and IT band, sciatic pain ( piriformis syndrome). Xrays revealed nothing (although at 62 I highly suspect some type of osteoarthirits), 6 sessions of therapy to correct what was a suspect patellar tracking disorder aggravated the condition, chiropractor, massage, Voltaren gel rubbed in the knee. Nothing brought long term relief. Three weeks ago I decided to give Alleve a try. And so far it's worked. I take one before bed. My knee occasionally hurts, but the tight hamstrings and sciatic have cleared up."
Helps inflamation but with excessive weight gain 10lb 1 mth.
"I am 51 yrs old with advanced Osteoarthritis in both hips, and on the surgery wait list to have THR.  Naproxen is quite amazing for me at controlling OA pain.  So far I only take it when I have upcoming situations where I will need to walk alot.  For these situations I'll take Naproxen 1-2 days in advance, 2 x 500mg tablet daily.  It makes a huge difference.  If I didn't worry about stomach or intestine damage I would take it continually.  Other days, I try to get by with low doses of ibuprofen."
I took 500 mg. No joy after 4 hours now still feeling no relief.
"I have MS and have been taking Naprelan CR 750 mg every morning for approx. 2 years, I take every morning and within minutes I can move. My Co-pay used to be $45, we changed health insurance and now it's $250  I don't know what I am going to do now. I cannot afford this."
I was prescribed 500mg 4 times a day..I feel no pain and able to work
"Took my first 500mg pill last night after supper, really feel good this morning, no pain when sleeping. Will post again in a week to update."
"Since high school I had terrible cramps/fatigue and nausea. I wasn't able to go about my normal activities. Until I switched doctors and she prescribed me the naproxen. I take it a few days before I get my period (when I get warning cramps). By the time my period comes I have no nausea and no fatigue, the cramps are still there but nowhere close to how bad I feel without the naproxen. I have to take this with food, because if I don't it messes with my stomach. Easy to take."
"My back pain started right after the kidney infection and tried X-ray, ultrasound, and therapy (still going for therapy), and physical massages. I avoided any medicine until I felt feverish one day and took one Advil pill. As I was sitting down comfortably and had to get up to make dinner, I noticed drastic change that I was in lesser pain, but still in pain. I was able to move better than I have been in two months. The physical therapy was helping, but it was a slow progress due to my work environment that requires me to lift heavy things. The massages were a bit helpful, but I wanted it everyday sort of a thing to get a relief. I ended up taking 2 Advils, but it wasn't enough for me. I told the doctor and she gave me this! No more pain!"
"I have severe Osteoarthritis my fingers twisted, my knees have had 1 replace. The other needs one, my hips, my feet and back. I find a Aleve gel caps work better than my Voltaren. I also use oxycodone to help me with severe pain."
"3 weeks with gout (June 20th-July 12): had to use a wheelchair before I found Walgreens All Day Pain Relief 220MG, 50 Tablets. Needed 2 pills for first 12 hours and 1 pill every 12 hours. It definitely relieved!"
"Unbelievable!  After suffering everyday with sciatica nerve pain, losing sleep, falling into depression, I tried one pill, Aleve. Nothing else I tried worked.  Aleve did exactly what my body needed to get relief from pain and inflammation.  I didn't want a narcotic, no. I will continue to take Aleve for a week to be sure that all traces of sciatica and inflammation are completely gone."
I don't even go to the foot doctor to refill my gout medicine anymore. Those little green pills are effective but make me feel terrible. Aleve is a tremendously effective medicine for my big toe gout and I DON'T have any side effects from it.
I had a herniated disc some 20 years ago and have never forgotten how effective Naproxen was at alleviating my condition. The results were astounding. Walked into a doctors surgery bent over almost double with severe sciatica. Prescribed Naproxen and took it immediately. Within 60 minutes I was walking like normal! I normally don't make comments on these kinds of thing but if it works even in a small number of people like it did me I am happy to share my experience. Try it nothing to lose no side effects I was aware of.
"This was my last chance to get relief,  my dr had advised that if we couldn't get the nerve to relax,  surgery was the next option.  The medication helped,  the only thing I would only take this at bed time.  This medication is very strong and makes you very sleepy, but it really does work. I only had to use it for a short time.  I will not take any thing longer than a month and only when I have to."
"I became very ill taking Aleve on a routine basis. I developed an intestinal ulcer, ringing in my ears, dizziness, vision changes the list goes on. "
"375 mg, three times a day was prescribed for my severe muscle pull near the left hip. Took the first pill at dinner time Thursday. Pain subsided a bit, but the medicine apparently wears off after 8 hours, because pain woke me up at 4:15 am Friday. Took pills at 4:30 am, 12 noon and again 8 pm.  Would estimate the pain was 1/3 less during the day. Sleep was again interrupted by hip pain: there was no positioning of the knees or legs that lessened the pain.  Today, Saturday, I took a pill at 7 am and will continue to dose every 8 hours.  Tomorrow I have to perform a concert while standing, so I'm counting on these to pull me through.   
Eager to get off these pills because of their scary effect on blood pressure."
"So when I started getting my period at about 13 I had the WORST CRAMPS EVER. Like I'm talking over the toilet, in the shower, missing school, and stuff like that. Typically it was only the first, rarely the second, day Of my cycle I would stay home or come home in bed feeling like my insides were flipping inside out. So after a couple months of this my mom got worried and took me to the doctor who told me I should go get an ultrasound on my uterus to make sure that there wasn't extra blood flow, extra lining, or anything. This is mostly because I didn't have blood clots so she wanted to make sure there wasn't something that needed attention pronto. nothing came up in the ultrasound. So I got prescribed naproxen and it's a LIFE SAVER!!!!"
This medicine is not helping at all. My back pain seems to be getting worse not better.
"I had ongoing pain and swelling for a full year after knee surgery to repair three rips in my right knee. It felt like bone rubbing on bone, felt hot to the touch with swelling  After going through narcotics and Motrin for swelling, I worked on accepting that I would be dealing with this for a long time as a chronic condition.  After my 1st dose of 500 mg of Naprosyn, it was a Godsend. For the 1st time in a year, my knee actually felt normal."
I only use when doing physical activity
This is an excellent pain medication as well as an anti inflammatory. I take 500 mg twice a day and had no adverse side effects.
My experienced was my period was non-stop for almost 2 month. I went to my gyn and prescribed me Naproxen for pain. It was so effective that my period went away in a week. Now when my period comes I'll take it right away. Thanks Naproxen.
"Naproxen was prescribed (x2 250mg ) for headaches I have been getting. Didn't seem to do a thing for that. However, the aches and pains in my joints (and trigger-finger related tendons) I have had for years go away pretty quickly. I feel 250mg lasts ~6hours until the pain starts to come back."
I was prescribed naproxen by my neurologist for menstrual migraines that left me debilitated every month with severe vomiting.  I now take 500mg each morning and night a few days before my period is due.  I started taking this preventative treatment of naproxen six months ago.  I still get headaches and occasional migraines but they are less severe and I have no vomiting.  Before taking Naproxen I was having at least three days off work each month.  I haven't had any time off since starting the tablets - really have improved my quality of life.
"I have a rare, incurable disease called Neurofibromatosis (Type 1). With this condition, pain is an everyday thing, especially back pain because I have scoliosis (a curve of the spine; side effect of NF1). In the past I would take 3 Ibuprofen, which had very little effect. Just yesterday I switched to Aleve; those first two pills really made a difference. My pain went away about an hour later and it worked a lot faster than the other medicines I've taken.

Thank you, Aleve!"
"I have Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and pain is an everyday thing, especially with scoliosis. Everyday I was taking Ibuprofen and that medicine had very little effect whatsoever. I switched to Aleve and as soon as I took those first two pills, I couldn't believe the results; my pain was gone an about an hour later."
"I have recently started using naproxen (prescription) for my migraines. I generally get migraines during my menstrual cycle and the doctor recommended taking naproxen (500 mg) every 12 hrs of that special week and so far it seems to be working. On other random days if I feel the slightest hinkling of a migraine coming on I take one naproxen and it seems to keep the migraine at bay. Naproxen has helped me have more control over my migraines, the odd time I still have to take a migraine pill such as Zomig."
This pill is a super strength Rx form of Aleve. If you have chronic pain it's good for inflammation of the joints that narcotic meds just cover up. Take them for breakthrough pain prn with food. They can be hard on your tummy like Tylenol type meds. I've lived with severe pain since 1989. In 2003 I was crushed between my back bumper of my car after running outta gas and the front grill of a Blazer SUV. My left leg was degloved. After a long hospital stay and many surgeries they saved my leg by reconstruction. I finally found a pain management Dr after jumping thru lots of hoops. I always fear loosing my meds before. I get where I no longer needs. them one day ( I hope). Good luck to those that aren't so fortunate as to find a compassionate Dr.
"Excellent medication. After taking a week of standard ibuprofen to treat tendonitis on my foot, I turned to naproxen. Within 2 doses the pain has stopped completed.

A few months ago I'd had some problems with my hip and similarly within 2 doses the pain settled completely."
Aleve helps a lot
"I recommend if for girls if they have menstrual pain. It  helps alot, 10-15 mins after I take the pill I feel no more pain!"
Unbelievable searing pain down the right side of my right leg always first thing in the morning after getting out of bed. I quickly take two Aleve with a glass of milk and wait for the pain to subside which usually takes about forty five minutes. I am then fine for the rest of the day. I also do yoga exercises later in the day which helps.
Used Naproxen for sciatica. Even had the prescription strength. It never upset my stomach but didn't help with my pain. 
Had hip strain due to car accident. Was in severe pain for one whole day. Took one tablet of naproxen 20mg that night. Don't know where the pain went next morning! Have not taken another pill
"Naproxen really helped my lower back. I have no pain after taking this medicine. Just remember, everyone's body is different and will respond to medication differently. Naproxen seems to working for a lot of people."
"I have severe chronic pain due to a car accident. I've tried every med to curb the pain. I like this medicine, the only drawback was that it wasn't long lasting and I wish I could take it more than once a day."
"I'm 17. I've been having back pains for three years on and off. One day I feel my spine and its curved. Got an appointment, recently got Xrays. Till the results I'm prescribed naproxen it works. Its very helpful I can sleep better."
"Absolutely amazing! I was suffering from severe back pain, and a pulsating sciatica from some kind of disc injury (no idea, didn't have MRI). The pain changed daily. On some days, I couldn't leave my bed, and on others, I could walk, but only for a short amount of time. I went to my family doctor, and she prescribed me some Naproxen 500MG tablets. I took the dosage, and the pain was gone in absolutely no time.

The dosage of 2 Naproxen Tablets will last me 2-3 days before the effects wore off. However, I still had difficulty walking for a moderate to long amount of time before the sciatica came back, and my lower back felt weak. No side effects either, so that's a plus."
Had a pain in left knee develop rather quickly. I am 70 and Dr. said was most likely arthritis. Prescribed Naproxyn and it worked very well for that knee. I have a bad right knee also that has been bad for 30 years and is getting worse. I hoped it would too get some relief but it has not. Curious about that. No noticeable side effects.
I have Achilles tendonitis and this does not relieve the pain too much.
"First let me say how bad are the cramps for me, they are the worst, like nothing else. I just cannot function in those days, legs feel like heavy stones that can't be moved, feeling dizzy and I don't want say how bad the stomach cramps are. So I've been taking ibuprofen for last year, it helped 3/10, then I decided to try Midol, which gave me worse day of my life, I took it in an empty stomach and I didn't get rid of ANY pain, it got worse and I threw up like 10 times in that day. So I went to my doctor who gave me naproxen. I got my period 6 hours before and I took it immediately, the pain to away in 20-30 mins and I feel wonderful now, I don't even feel I'm on my period. Also I avoided caffeine in last 10-12 days, and exercised LOTS."
"I'm 31 years old and I'm in the military, I always had severe and heavy periods with really bad cramps. Before I went in the military and I had my periods, I used to just relax and take maybe 2 Advil and it would pass but now everyday I have to move and workout and endure the pain and its horrible. So when I told my friend about that she told me she was in the same situation and she gave me naproxen and it was a life saver. Now I barely feel any cramps and even my flow isn't heavy anymore! I can finally focus on my job. I am so happy this medicine works."
"I was prescribed Naproxen for menstral cramps due to Endometriosis, but it works wonders on headaches!"
"As I got older and 7 kids later my menstrual pain took a turn for the worst, I have severe cramping and fatigue this medication was never prescribed to me after being rushed to the emergency room numerous times. My husband was given this medication for back pain and I was in so much pain that I decided to try it. This medicine has saved my life. I will go get my own prescription!"
Worked for pain but caused severe nausea for me.
"I am young and have been suffering from severe to extreme neck pain resulting in debilitating headaches for as long as I can remember. 

I have done every natural therapy known to me including myotherapy, acupuncture, deep tissue massage, Bowen therapy, chiropractic and osteopathy therapy, etc.

The therapy alone was costing me $800 a month plus pain killing medications. I started to believe I was addicted to codeine because I associated it with withdrawal like symptoms. 

I then went back to my GP and was told to have X-rays including an MRI after seeing a rheumatologist specialist. 

Diagnosed with cervical osteoarthritis and also osteoarthritis in my hip. Last winter I couldn't even put on my undies. 

Naprosyn saved me! Simple."
"I have my headaches mostly under control with Vivactil. But I do occasionally feel one coming on and for that I am now taking naproxen. Used to take Vicodin. No more. I went from almost daily killer headaches to an occasional now and so far, one naproxen has worked."
Takes away swelling from knee post-surgery.
"I have had very big problems. Been taking Norco and muscle relaxers. I stopped taking the Norcos..didn't help!
I went to the ER and was given naproxen and soma. Thank you. After two 500mg pills and 1 day of taking them, I can move. No pain in my hip and I can work. "
"I suffered severe and excruciating pain, sensitiveness to light, nausea, vomiting cold sweats every morning due to migraines.  I tried almost every pain medicine in the book and only found relief when the Dr. prescribed Naprosyn, I can't remember the dosage, sorry.  But it was a 12 hour pill so I was able to take it at night and not have to wait 20 minutes of pain like other medicines to kick in. it really was a God send for me!"
"I suffer from gout in my feet periodically because I do not take preventative medicines. My last bout I tried Tylenol extra strength first and got no relief. I switched to Aleve gel caps and immediately felt the pain decrease. I am a believer and also an Aleveir, thanks a lot."
"Feminax Ultra for period pain, in the UK. Gets rid of gout pain immediately within 1 hour. Swelling reduced to nothing in 12 hours. Simply Awesome, can't say anything other than that. "
"Ibuprofen bothers my stomach so I tried Aleve/naproxen some years back and as to this day it works better then anything else, over the counter, that I have taken. It may not take away all the pain but it takes that evil edge off so the pain becomes less likely to make me vomit. I take Aleve in the morning to prevent the pains and again when I do get the pains. "
"Injured my ankle one day and this caused me to sit around for two weeks. Normally, I have a very active lifestyle but sitting for two weeks caused a old knee injury to flare up. To make this short I take naproxen once every morning and have had very little pain since. "
I started taking this medicine about 6 months ago.  I was recently hospitalized for blood in my stools.  It was found out that Naproxen was the cause. I will have to find another medicine to help with my rheumatoid arthritis. I was not aware of the side effects.  I believe that this information should be more and more publicized. 
"Fell onto my shoulder off my sons skate board, initially felt no discomfort, but my shoulder a week or so after began to become painful, enough to stop me swimming. Waited 3 months for it to go, no reduction on pain, went to doctor who prescribed Naprosyn within a day or two pain had eased, carried on for 2 weeks and now swim regularly, very slight discomfort but take remaining pills as and when needed, but discomfort so small rarely have to take them. 
Negatives, I think when taking medication I suffered stomach discomfort."
I love naproxen.  I am 73 and plagued with lower back and neck pain.  After two days my pain was GONE!  I have been taking it twice a day.  I am afraid to stop because I don't want my pains back!  Now I have a script from my doctor.  Medicare pays for it.  I pay $2.65.  Love it. 
As a physician and a sufferer of gout I can say without doubt that Naproxen works just as well as Indomethacin. 
"Calms my Migraines a bit, but then they go back to normal or even worse. Not the best medication for me."
"Since beginning my period at the age of 12, I have experienced tremendous pain. So much so that I'd miss school, work, events, etc. I'd be in bed writing in unbelievable pain for the first day or two...on the toilet bent over in pain and dropping clots...losing weight...having absolutely zero energy - it'd take me about a week to feel somewhat normal again after each period. I've tried everything - you name it, I've tried it.  Since my new gynecologist prescribed naproxen, it has been LIFE CHANGING. The first time I took it, the beginnings of pain were gone in 20 minutes! So, for the first time in 22 years, I had NO pain with my period. That's a LONG time to have pain! I can't believe no one gave this to me sooner! It's GREAT!"
"I bent over and suddenly experienced severe pain.  With either a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle, I could barely make it to a nearby chair.  I took 2 Aleve and applied an ice pack for the entire afternoon.  Within 45 minutes I could slowly walk and I continued to take Aleve as recommended on the bottle.  The next day I resumed my life as usual and in 3 or 4 days I no longer needed Aleve.  Wow, better than a chiropractor."
"Works very well for back pain especially when it also affects the surrounding muscles. But, you should always take it after a meal as it can cause serious stomach pain."
Prescription strength Naproxen and Mucinex D are the only things to relieve pain and pressure when I have one of my frequent maxillary sinus infections.
I have occasional stomach upset but its nice not to hurt. I take it three times a day and at night. I take it with Flexeril.
"I take this for significant pain caused by osteoarthritis.  Before my GP put me on it I was losing every morning to barely being able to walk on my knee due to the pain.  Started seeing results in less than 24 hours.  I was prescribed another medicine with it to prevent side effects, and some other pain killers so sometimes a bit ashamed of the combination, but for the first time in years I am almost entirely pain free all day every day."
"Back pain from accident squared away after second dose. The pain went all the way to my foot and up my back into my neck and shoulder. Just started medicine today!!!
10/11/2012"
I have been on medication for 14 months whilst the doctor tried to work out what the pain was. Finally had an MRI and I have 3 slipped discs. Have 100mg Tramadol 4x a day with 20mg Amitryptiline and it has no effect whatsoever. I read about Naproxen and have been prescribed it today.  The relief was almost immediate and I am hoping for my first solid nights sleep in over a year. Fingers crossed.
Made a big difference in my hip and knee pain
Does not help with my chronic pelvic pain. 
"After 2 decades of seeking relief from bad menstrual cramps and who knows how many gynos (who either accused me of drug seeking or threw narcotics at me, then branded me noncompliant for refusing narcotics) I found a doctor who gave me naproxen. He explained something about its blood thinning properties and how it thins the blood before it sheds from the uterus, as where blot clots the uterus when the shed. MADE SO MUCH SENSE! Especially after the wonderful results. Flow is extremely heavier for the 1st 2 days, then barely a streak for the next 5 days, but NO pain, not even a pinch! Miracle! Taken 3 days before also completely eliminates sore breasts and bloating. If I didn't bleed I wouldn't even know I was having a period. No joke."
"Didn't see results, I am a young baseball pitcher and lately my elbow has been killing even days after games.

Doctor prescribed me 500mg Naproxen EC and I find I have no results and my elbow is still inflamed, feels like carpel tunnel in my elbow still"
"Works great. No noticable side effects. Cost is pretty high, but my insurance covers it."
Suffered neck and spine pain for years. One night I took it and was I surprised how great this medicine worked. And I'm pain free all night and day after taking Aleve. I make sure I have it in my medicine cabinet. It's a keeper....Thanks for this great medicine!
Naproxen has not worked for me at all. It is just like taking Advil or Aleve. 
"WARNING to the user of Naproxen who posted on here, that after taking naproxen, they experienced hives and weakness.  This means you are allergic to it and should consult your doctor immediately.  Taking Benadryl may alleviate the symptoms but the symptoms may worsen over time. It may not be the medicine for you.  Please consult your doctor. "
"I work retail at a large home improvement company. Most of the day it works fine, but a lot of times I have to do heavy lifting. It does not help with that. I have had to on numerous occasions stop and take a break just to get through the day."
"Suffered for 25 years, though not quite as bad now as in my teens/20s. Missing one day of my life each month to horrendous pain/nausea/fever/chills total lack of mental focus. This seems to fix everything! Amazing, wish I'd had this when I was 15."
"At first I took Ibuprofen but that does nothing for Sciatica.  I went to the doctor because I could not walk and our physician said that Ibuprofen doesn't work for this, Naproxen does.  So about 500 mg and wow, it's fantastic.  Take it with buttermilk, yogurt, or a yogurt drink to keep your stomach in good shape."
"When I have sciatica pain in my hip I quickly eat something (protein bar often works), take two Aleve, then lay down on the floor and put my legs up on a chair. Sometimes I put an ice pack on the area also, and I lay there for 10-20 minutes and the pain almost always subsides. Then I make sure to stretch a bit so the pain doesn't return when the Aleve wears off. Aleve works GREAT when I'm in pain, but don't forget how vital it is to stretch and exercise also. "
This is the best non-narcotic pain reliever that I've ever used. Motrin makes me throw up if I don't take it with food. It makes me nauseous even with food. Aspirin is a sugar pill for me and Exedrin just gets me high on caffeine. This really gets rid of the pain.
"I too have Ankylosing Spondylitis and it started when I was only 19. The flares of inflammation were 6 months apart in the first couple years. When I got my first bad flare though I thought I was going to die. Finally after a month of not being able to move, sit-up, walk, or lay on anything but my side. I finally got out the walker and made it down the stairs although in excruciating hip pain. Felt like knives were being stabbed into my sciatic nerve. I then realized after I went to the emergency room that an NSAID was to thank for my relief! Thank you Naproxen."
"As I grew older my pains grew worse. Since I've discovered naproxen, I never worry about period pains anymore because it soothes the pain within 15-20mins!"
"I took Aleve for one year for tendonitis in my wrist. The medication worked very well in reducing the swelling and pain. However, one year later I have just found out that it has been the culprit behind significant weight gain and bloating. I gained 25 lbs in 4 months. I am stopping Aleve and will try to find a natural way to treat my tendonitis."
"I had 2 abscess teeth and my dentist gave me these. It took a while for it to kick in, but when it did it was better than any other thing."
It caused tummy aches for my 6 year old
"Did not help much with the pain. After 2 months on this medicine my blood pressure started to spike and I have had  five trips to the ER with blood pressure at 180/120, severe dizziness and chest pain. Both a persistant dull pain and stabbing pain at different locations in my chest and abdomen. One week of and the dizzines and chest pain is gone. Blood preasure high still but better. Its the Diastolic preasure that is high. Be very careful with this medicine. Take your blood pressure several times before starting and monitor your pressure during treatment."
"Worked very well. Felt the pain intensifying, got the Aleve a few hours later, started with 2 tablets then 1 every 8 hours. Will do this for a few days. Very rapid relief of Gout big toe pain."
It took a few weeks before I felt any difference in my chest pain but it helps relieve some of the pain so I could lay down and sleep at night.
My gynecologist suggested I take one of these at the first twinge of a cramp.  Every now and then I get horrible debilitating cramps.  This medicine has saved me.  I take one pill and I know within about 30 minutes I'll be feeling a lot better and won't have any cramps.
Works great. Love it.
Works GREAT. Take it once a day and I'm done. Cost is outrageous though.
Aleve works better than anything I've tried. Like other users have stated take 3-4 initially ever 8 hours then reduce to 1-2 ever 8 hours until gout attack is completely gone.  It took 1 day to reduce a full-on gout attack to a state where it is barely noticeable.  
"I am on my second day of using naproxen due to my really bad period pain. I usually have to take time off work and am left crying in pain for the first few days of my period. So far, the only thing that naproxen has stopped for me is the pain that makes me cry. The pain is still very strong. "
"I started taking Aleve for my Arthritis in my hand and the pain was gone but after taking it for about 8 days I noticed swelling in my feet, which was abnormal for me. I am 34 and in good health and have never had swollen feet. I then noticed the next day my feet and hands were swollen. I finally put 2 and 2 together and realized I was allergic to the Aleve. I stopped taking it and haven't had swelling since."
"I have temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. My oral surgeon prescribed naproxen for jaw pain and I discovered  only 4 days of taking this medicine, I found great relief in my arthritis in which I have most everywhere.
I hope to continue to take this medicine."
"Sciatica pain since June. October started Naproxen 500 and obvious changes. No pain from back to calf, can stand for longer periods of time without pain and leg numbness. Very happy. "
"Two Aleve a day helped my back pain, but over time it affected my stomach. My gastroenterologist knew immediately what my problem was and I've stopped Aleve entirely. I had almost a year of constant nausea and pain until I quit taking Aleve."
"These work well if you rest. Took 2 on the first day and was starting to think they were useless, took 2 the next day and by 11pm I felt so much better, had no pain and slept like a brick. The trick is to keep taking these for at least 2 days, by then you should feel better. Note to others who get given these, make sure you get given Lansoprazole as well as these protect your stomach."
"I strained my back while lifting. The pain was very bad, I couldn't walk or get out of bed. Took naproxen and within hour I could walk and move again. But I wouldn't say the pain was completely gone. There was still soreness but this medicine made the pain at least bearable."
Caused vomiting and gave me worst headache.
"This medicine saved me.  Starting about the age of 15 I began to experience menstrual cramps for the first time.   It was the very worst pain I had ever felt at that time.  Not content to only hurt in my lower abdomen the pain radiated all the way down the front of my legs to my ankles.  I couldn't sit still.  All I could do was pace back and forth crying.  I couldn't find a single pain reliever that worked; we had the usual in the house, aspirin, ibuprofen, even Midol.  Finally my mother became so worried she took me to the doctor.  I thought I was going to have to be on some kind of strong prescription medication.  What does he do, he returns to the room with about 50 samples of Aleve and it has been my miracle drug ever since."
"I have been taking Naproxen for 7 months 500mg and it is very effective but does have an impact on the stomach. I recently caught gastroenteritis and what normally lasts for 48 hours lasted 11 days, which may have been down to my weakened stomach lining. I was dehydrated and lost 1.5 stone. I am now going to try and manage the pain with ibuprofen and paracetamol."
"(Male, 42yrs, 220lbs, active/athletic). I take 375mg once in the morning for the relief of occasional (4-5 times a year) severe back muscle pain. While it unfortunately takes 2-4 hours for me to feel the effects, when it has been absorbed it gives me 90-100% relief and the benefits last for roughly 48 hours. This is by far the best pain reliever I have ever used. As for adverse side effects, luckily I can't seem to detect any. "
"I am a 47 year old female with a knee injury. The doctor gave me Anaprox 550 mg twice a day and I was not able to take it. I started taking it and on the third day, I started getting sick to my stomach, lost appetite and was dizzy. I cut down to 275mg twice a day and I still felt quizzy. This is too strong for me."
"After severe lumbar pain caused by lugging a 5-gallon bucket full of dirt about 100 yards, I tried over-the-counter Doan's tablets and got no relief. Then, my physician gave me 4 Naprelan which I took one a day. In only six days total, my lumbar pain had vanished."
"Stops a gout attack in its tracks, but it is essential to kick off with a large dose (600mg or greater) followed by regular low doses."
"Really good at back pain relief, but after extended use [ I have 2 ruptured discs] my skin started to tear easily, but I was in my 30's at the time. So I don't use for long periods but occasional usage is fine."
"Great for day to day pain, but lacking if you do lots of heavy lifting in a day."
"Midol Extended Relief is the best pain reliever for my period.  I used to take 800mg Ibuprofen because I get terrible cramping, now I prefer the Midol.  I don't have to take it as often and since it is Midol it relieves more than just the cramps.  Every woman in my office uses it for cramps."
One every 8 hours dulls the pain but sufficient dosage to kill the pain elicits some skin and stomach side effects.
I've used naproxen sodium for five years (500 - 1000mg daily as needed) with no side effects. I am 66 years old.
"I went to see the doctor after 2 days of heat and inactivity did not help my back. After examining me and taking X-rays he prescribed the Naprelan 500mg time release for me. He also went as far as to warn me that even though I would feel better it was not healed and I needed to take it easy. I am so glad he did because after 2 days I felt almost back to normal even though the back condition was such that I am be referred to physical therapy for it. Long story short, this medicine works, just be careful."
"I was involved in a car accident in 2005 in which my urethra was severed. Since surgery it has had a an going problem with closing off with scar tissue. I have to self catheterize, which results in inflammation in the area. Naproxen at 500mg has been the only anti-inflammatory that has worked in this area. Also effective for muscle pain."
I have been taking Naproxen for a long time.  I just found out from my Cardiologist that it is causing my high blood pressure. It can damage the kidney and liver.  
"Naproxen works pretty well, except that it tends to wear off well before the next dose is due. It works for about 8 or 9 hours and then begins wearing off."
Doesn't help my back pain.
"I recently acquired sciatica and it is painful at times. Usually at the end of the day after walking. I started a new job that has stairs everywhere (along with elevators) Using the stairs everyday seems to have helped it (hanging on to the rails). But, the Naproxen twice a day is helping me to use the stairs. Naproxen once a day wasn't cutting it. Just one floor at a time, then the elevator. 

I'm convinced that the inflammation is the culprit as it causes tendons to become sticky and grind tendons against muscles when moving causing pain incrementally as the day progresses. I had a motorcycle accident and landed hard on my toosh."
"I love Aleve, but people should talk to their doctor first.  I have sometimes severe pain in my toes and severe headaches from TMJ, and the Aleve significantly cuts down on my pain from both.  Don't forget to talk to your doctor because risk of stomach bleeding and risk of heart attack rises with some users."
"Did cause slight drowsiness, but controlled the pain of aggravated calcific tendonitis in my shoulder much better than I expected. Allowed me to sleep at night again and regain much range of motion."
"I love Aleve! It makes all my lower back pain disappear, I feel like a new person."
"My hip and shoulder have hurt for years and I have always taken Bayer aspirin and I tried Aleve arthritis gelcap.  To my surprise the pain in my hip and shoulder went away for 8 hours.  The only thing I don't know is how long I could take the stuff, the bottle said do not take for longer than 10 days.  The warning label about it could cause stroke or heart attack did raise questions."
"One thing I've learned is to avoid dairy products and too much fat about a week to 10 days before my period. I helps a lot with reducing bloating and cramps. I still have to use medication to control the cramps, but no dairy makes a huge difference."
Really worked for me.  I had significant pain and inflamation of my big toe.  Symptoms were getting worse until I took Aleve.  Almost immediate (1/2 hr) relief from pain and within one day of use the pain was gone and by the 2nd day the swelling was reduced.
"I just starting to take Aleve, I take one every morning. So far no bad side effects. It sure has improve my joint pain and stiffness."
Good.
"My menstrual cramps have always been out of control. I would miss school and work every month for 2 or 3 days doing nothing but laying in bed with a heating pad, overdosing on Midol, and crying my eyes out. I would be in so much pain. Once I matured and moved from seeing a pediatrician to a gynecologist 3 years ago my doctor prescribed me Naproxen for my extreme pain. For the most part it relieves me of all my pain, but every now and then (even with the naproxen) my period still hits me pretty hard but it is bearable."
Killed my stomach. Never had problems before taking this and I took Aleve with food.
"I had anterior cervical corpectomy 3 weeks ago, in pain constantly, don't want to get addicted to harder drugs so I am trying this, has helped immensely. Will continue, now can get a good nights sleep pain free, try it."
"I suffer from severe form of Ankylosing Spondylitis. My spine is totally fused. I have had all kinds of drugs to control the pain. Recently the pain had reached my neck, it was unbearable. I took so many different kinds of pain killers all prescribed by the doctors and none worked.
Until my daughter gave me ALEVE to try and for the first time in my life I want to be a spokesman for your company."
"I have metal rods on my spine, my lower back gets a burning. I take naproxen it takes it out in about 1 hour."
Did not help my back pain at all. A week after starting the medication I had ONE glass of wine at about 8pm. Less then an hour later I passed out and did not wake up until 2pm the next day. I missed work and apparently my family was trying to wake me up but I seemed to be sleep walking and have no recollection of what I was saying. 
I have not had any side effects that I know of and I have been on this for about 2 years. It help's keep the pain away for a while and when it is bad it takes the sharp edge off the pain but I also use a hot water bottle for ease and comfort when it is bad.
"I suffer from severe arthritis due in part to extensive cervical fusion. About 2 months ago my doctor prescribed Naproxen and I am pleasantly surprised with the results so far. While I am not a fan of NSAIDs *any* relief from this pain is worth the risk.

It doesn't do much for breakout pain but when I get that nagging pain in my neck it does help, but only in conjunction with a pain killer."
Did its job but made me lethargic.
"I take one Aleve in the morning, one at night and can't believe the relief I've experienced from painful, arthritic  knees."
"2 OTC naproxen (Aleve) every 8 hours starting with onset of gout attack with pain; then 2 Aleve every 12 hours for 3  days, or until pain is gone; reduce to 1 Aleve every 12 hours as soon as possible.
NOTE: This works great for acute control of pain, but be SURE to see your MD about starting you on Allopurinol to markedly reduce chances of getting gout attacks (reduces uric acid excess)."
This website is very useful
"A surgeon recommended that I have a procedure to deal with the effects of several ruptured disks in my lower back.  I prefer to put off the surgery for as long as I can, and use Aleve on an almost daily basis.  It works just fine for me, and I only have an incident about every 1.5 years, and usually because I overdo the yard work. When it gets very bad, I supplement with an anti spasmodic drug for a few days."
"I've had RA for 4 years.  500mg naproxen tablets were my first treatment.  They definitely helped the day get better and be able to function daily.  However, they did not stop the morning stiffness and pain or the build up of inflamation in my body.  I definitely needed a more serious drug to stop the progression of the disease."
"Aleve helped with pain.
Took 1 pilll after dinner but had bad side effects.
Stomach pain really sharp, bloating, diarrhea, my intestines were making noises , runny bloody stools.
Pain was unbearable.
No more Aleve for me."
"Does not help with pain, just with swelling."
This is like a miracle drug. I couldn't even get out of bed without pain. Now I am pain free. Awesome
"This drug was used by my fiance, and it made her really dizzy, she couldn't even stand up."
Fibromyalgia - slow to take effect but once the pain relief begins it is effective for me and much preferable to codeine.
"Helped the inflammation and pain, but gave me insomnia."
I do have extremely severe headaches and this drug tends to give relief more often than not. A bit surprised and concerned about the side effects warnings.
"I've had frequent steroidal shots in my shoulder for bursitis, but my doctor recommended trying naproxen sodium instead this visit.  I am very pleased with the pain relief, as long as I remember to take it!"
Good job Naproxen. My back pain is gone. 
I have been using Aleve for about 6 months.  This medicine helps relieve all my aches and pains.  I'm 68 and working in food industry.  Although I experience severe body and joint pains on a daily basis I take one Aleve on the days I work and can put in 4 to 6 hours pain free.  I have not suffered any side effects so far.  So far none of the other medicines I have tried have been as effective as Aleve.
"I took 2 Aleve after spending a sleepless night with terrible shoulder pain.  It starting working within 30 minutes.  Within 1 hour, I could rotate my arm in all directions.  Pain relief lasted a good 24 to 28 hours before the pain came back.  This is a wonderful product!"
I am above middle age and have pain due to diabetic neuropathy. Broke out with severe facial rash.
Pain from surgery use of gas. Gas pain excruciating. Naproxen best for control of pain without side effects of narcotics.
Incredibly helpful - short term use.
"Very few (one, normally) will cure any headache I have had."
"I took 2 for lower back pain, definitely muscle and it didn't really help."
"Upon taking Naproxen, I immediately get dizzy, break out in hives, and become very weak.  But taking Benadryl immediately after the symptoms began relieved all of the symptoms."
"Wow. I have tried all kinds of over the counter medicines like Midol, Tylenol, and Advil for period pain. Midol seemed to help the best, but it just wasn't enough. My doctor prescribed me Naproxen. I'm so glad she did. It's all I need for cramps now. It works fast, too. I'd say it takes around 15 or 20 minutes to kick in. I just took one this morning, and my pain is almost all the way gone already. The directions say to take it the day before it starts, which is hard for me to predict sometimes, but if I take it at the right time, I experience almost no pain during my period. I also get migraines, and if I feel one coming on, I take one of these, then take a nap. When I wake up, the pain is usually gone. I'm taking 250 mg."
"Works well for back, shoulder and knee pain"
I have been prescribed this medicine twice now and both times is hasn't helped.
"So far so good, for chronic neck pain/spasm. It's the first time I've tried it and my neck has never felt better. The only side effect has been mild heartburn but I'd rather that than not being able to move my neck."
"Aleve worked very well for my neck and back pain but I had side effects... shortness of breath, feeling faint, and my tongue started to swell. I stopped the medicine and was okay the next day."
"I took Naproxen for eight months before my doctor associated it with the severe side effect of my throat swelling and the feeling of something stuck in my throat, stomach bleeding and neck pain and enduring an oesophagoscopy."
"This medication is very helpful for the pain in my shoulder, my doctor told me it's rotator cuff.  I haven't had any side effects."
"I was amazed at how quickly my pain was reduced, after just 3 doses of Naprosyn. I had suffered from the pain of tendonitis in my thumb/hand for 5 weeks before taking the medicine. Of course I wish I had seen the doctor weeks ago."
Only thing that works for me.
"It's absolutely wonderful for period cramps. For me, they're effective within 20 minutes, and they're the only things that work."
"It works phenomenally. However, 2 a day doesn't keep the pain away for 24 hours."
"I have taken l x Aleve 500 every morning for about 2 years and have found it is the only medication that completely relieves my pain. My only concern is the side effects and I don't know how long I can stay on this medication. As of yet I far as I know I have not had any side effect. I am 84 years of age.

"I use it for long-term muscle swelling and back discomfort. It works pretty good for the most part, it doesn't fix all the pain, but it definitely makes it more tolerable."
Makes me feel very unwell.
"This drug works very well on alleviating the osteoarthritis pain but once in a while I get a side effect.  Specifically, it is stomach upset, and randomly it is a metallic taste in my mouth."
"I am currently taking Celebrex and Prednisone for my Sciatica, 12 days now and no relief. Desperate for pain relief I took 1 naproxen 500mg. Thank God I did.
 
The pill is a little hard to swallow, and it may make you a little nauseous but it will definitely ease the pain and will allow you to get some much needed sleep."
"This medication seems to help the pain, but causes upset stomach and ringing in ears."
"It works great but gave me severe stomach cramps, pain, and general gastrointestinal distress."
I took three pills over 36 hours and had a serious side effect. Was covered in hives from head to toe for another 48 hours.  
Medicine worked great. Took 1 tablet a day to keep the knee swelling and stiffness away. Only side effects seem to be bloating and gas. Haven't take in two weeks (surgery done) and my symptoms are reducing. Looking at taking again since my surgery I have swelling but no pain. 
It helps a lot. Try to avoid prolonged use. Side effects can be severe.
The most effective over-the-counter drug to reduce the effects of tendonitis.  My tendons can stay inflammed for years and usually only respond to steriod injections.  Aleve has proven to be just as effective.
The most effective over-the-counter drug to reduce the effects of tendonitis.
Effective 12 hour pain medicine but caused significant long term gastro-intestinal disruption.
In 2 doses my pain was at a 2 and the use of my arms were at 90%.
"This medicine does help to a degree, but I do experience break through pain and discomfort. Especially in cold and damp weather, in injury sites from a car accident."
Best medicine I ever took for back pain.
These pills are helping me with arthritis. I have arthritis all over the place. From my upper back all the way to my legs.
I can certainly tell a difference when I don't take Naprosyn. I take 500 mg twice a day if needed.
It was great help. Thanks
Works well.
"Works well on inflammation, however I get a shortness of breath when I go for a run (this might not be related)."
"Absolutely better than the narcotic pain relievers at relieving the 'acute' blinding pain of a toothache. Within 30 minutes the pain is gone, for 12 hours. Awesome."
This is the most amazing drug ever invented. It makes all my worries and pains be free like a bird.
"I have been using the Naproxen 500 mg for a few months now and ever since I have been using it, it has really, really helped me out. I have scoliosis with about a 40 degree curve and developing arthritis in my spine where it curves. This really seems to help out a great deal."
"I am taking this medicine for Tendonitis from shoulder to wrist. Before Naproxen I had zero strength and very minimal movement. After a week on Naproxen (after 2 hours) I have most movement and strength.
Side effects are nausea but it is mild. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory properties are just as beneficial to healing, as is the pain relief (relaxation of tendons). "
I have been using Naproxen 500mg for a heel spur and it turns out it is working on my knee cap arthritis.  I eat well and then take the pill with milk so not to kill the lining of my stomach.  This pill is a wonder drug for treating arthritis especially on the knee cap.  I will have to tell my doctor when I see him for my last Orthovisc injection.  It has made a huge difference for me.
"This is at present a God-send. I tore my shoulder muscles at work, nothing removed that sickening inside pain, you know the one where it makes you irritable with loved ones. This has dulled the pain after an hour. I'm actually smiling and can concentrate again. Hope this helps more out there."
I recently had my meniscus removed from my knee and am now dealing with arthritis in the knee which is hampering my recovery. I started on naproxen and didn't realize how helpful it's been until I switched to a cream version. Within a day I was in constant pain and could not exercise at all.  I went back on the pill form and was back walking nearly normal before the 2nd dose.
"This medication for cramps is the BEST. It's weird but my cramps only happen in the morning before my actual period comes.  The pain starts literally within twenty minutes of waking.  I pop one of these and within an hour, I'm fine.  I usually don't have to take another pill even though you can take the medication twice a day.  I've been using it for a year.  It's great."
It is good.
I felt brand new.
"This is a great drug. It is fast acting and effective. I get severe migraines and this drug works really well. It stops it in its tracks, which a blessing to me as some of my migraines last 3 days."
At the first sign of Gout I pop two Aleve Liquid Gels. Usually is enough to kill it. I'll sometimes chase it with tylenol arthritis if I wake up in the morning with a full blown attack. Good partial fix if you can't get to the doctor for prednisone or any other gout medication.
Used it for 3 days. Ankle swelling and pain now much reduced and can walk properly on left leg. Still some pain in big toe.
I can't swallow pills.  I've tried taking them crushed and nothing will stay down long enough to kill the pain.  I'm now on liquid naproxen and it is wonderful.  Kills the pain and the nausea.
I use this for lower back and hip pain. It works very well on the sciatic pain I get from injury to my back and hip. the only other drug that helps is at least 800mg of motrin. Naproxen works for about 7 hours while motrin only lasts 3-4 hours. I think these basically relieve swelling pressure on the nerve column.
Take one Naproxen 500 for severe sinus headaches.  Within 20 minutes you are back to normal.  The best drug ever invented!
"Naproxen is working fine for me, no visible side effects. I damaged my right wrist 15 years ago cutting nerves (veins and major artery). Most of my pain is through nerve damage. Naproxen relives pain, sort of takes the edge off."
"I used Naproxen when I tore a tendon in my knee and the swelling would not go down. Naproxen works. It takes some time but you have to be on a regular dose and once you stop taking it, it goes back to the way it was before (at least in my case it did)."
"I have suffered with right lower back pain for many years. I have taken Flexeril, Ibuprofen800, Percocet all of which dulled the pain or put me to sleep. My doctor put me on Naprelan and after two doses I am almost completely free of back pain."
I have been using this for a few weeks and it really helps with my Sacroiliac joint pain.
I use this for back pain.  Helps me alot!
The only thing that helps my severe period pain.
"I have been using Naproxen 500mg for at least 8 years. I find this product very helpful for period pain, although if you take it to late, it sometimes takes up to an hour to relieve the pain, but when it goes it takes a long time to come back. I haven't had any side effects or none that I've noticed. "
"My Dr. prescribed Naprelan for me on March 10th..By March 12th. my condition had improved 85%!!!
Ladybugluv"
I have TMJ and it was causing severe headaches. I was given Naprelan to  take down the inflammation in my jaw. Within two days I was feeling much better and could even open my mouth wider.
Not a very good pain killer.
Naproxen has helped my pain a lot. Just remember to take it with food.
We find Aleve most helpful with aches and pains.
"I started taking it as prescribed, 2 daily with meals, and I started to have terrible stomach pain and bloating. It wasn't until I read the side effects and reviews that I realized my stomach pain was caused by Naproxen. I wouldn't give my worst enemy this, the pain is unbearable. Stomach pain is so bad I could cry."
"Took Naproxen 500mg for 6 days, twice a day. Two weeks later and I'm still recovering from abdominal pain. In 2 weeks is my endoscopy. My GI doctor thinks I may have an ulcer. I wish I had not taken this medicine."
"Be very careful if you are sensitive to drugs. I took naproxen for a day and a half for period pain. It did stop the cramps but what came next was horrible. At 1am I woke up with severe upper abdominal pain and was rushed to hospital. I stayed in emergency for 7 hours with nausea and was given endone and a numbing drink to try and alleviate the pain but that still didn’t help. In the end, blood tests revealed I had acute pancreatitis from Naproxen, a rare side effect. I’m still recovering 10 days later. I will never touch this drug again. Ibuprofen and paracetamol have always been fine for me. Read the long list of side effects first!!!"
"I wish I never took naproxen. I ended up worrying about low blood sugar too much because of the ph in some waters, ate too much, and vomited all over the place. I never had this much anxiety in a very long time! I definitely would NOT recommend this medicine, especially for migraines like I have. It caused me to be extra hungry and thirsty at the same time which had also caused me to worry about low blood sugar. I want off this medication!"
I was prescribed naproxen and within 5 days of taking it I had to stop because it had given me a severe rash. After 3 days my joints had swollen so badly I couldn’t walk. I went to the hospital and was admitted with vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) the doctors estimate it will take me 3 weeks to recover from this. This has been the worst illness I’ve ever had. Do not take this!
"Was prescribed naproxen for an inflammed ovary. Instead this medicine caused me to feel nauseous, dizzy, made me throw up, drowsy, gave me a rapid heartbeat and chest pains. I’d rather live with the inflammed ovary over ever taking this pill again. I do not recommend it."
Sciatica pain … The Aleve was worthless.
Felt unwell as soon as I took the first tablet - followed all instructions about how to take the medicine. I preserved with it for 12 days by which time it caused bleeding from stomach and bowel. Within hours I had lost so much blood I required a blood transfusion.
Lower back pain and depression. After reading the side effects I will stop this medication.
Consultant prescribed 500 mg X 2 a day along with anti acids for rheumatoid arthritis could only take for 1 day as although the pains in my knees were significantly better the pains I had in my stomach were very painful & I wouldn't go through it again so took all medication to the pharmacy to be disposed of.
"I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in November and prescribed 00mg Naproxen twice a day and 1 omeprazole to protect my stomach. I t worked wonders, I was out of pain for the first time in months, able to resume work and my normal activities. Forward 3 months and i began experiencing dizziness, nausea, stomach pain, exhaustion, just lifting my arms ached & finally black stools at which point I was diagnosed with internal bleeding and taken off the Naproxen immediately. It's a very effective but do be aware of the side effects and stop taking it if you feel unwell. My doctor said i could have died."
"Hi.. I literally had the worse headache ever! I only had Naproxen so I took two. Within less then a hour I felt so so ill!!! Before I could do anything I was sick 4 times :(.. n a lot of it! If you use this drug, make sure to eat properly before!"
Took naproxen for back and neck pain before bed and woke up with severe stomach pains so bad I couldn’t get back to sleep. They lasted the entire day and were so uncomfortable I wouldn’t take this drug if it was the last pain med on the planet.
My doctor stopped my Naproxen about t weeks ago and joint pain has increased severlely again so I am going back to ask for it to be reinstated to control my osteoarthritis.
"Awful! Have only taken for 3 days and although it gives slight relief to the pain in my back from pulling a muscle, the side effects are horrific. Upset tummy, nausea and the worst stomach pain. Id rather the back pain than the stomach pains that are making me feel so ill!"
"I tried Aleve (naproxen) because it was advertised as a safe and long lasting pain control. I soon realized that for myself it only worked if I only took a dose once in a while. The 1st dose works marvelously the second does nothing. I've spoken to quite a few people who've tried it and most had the same experience. Happily I haven't had any of the side-effects listed here and I don't think anyone else I spoke to has either but since reading the possible complications and the fact it doesn't work on an on going basis for me anyways, it's not worth the risk since my mother died of kidney disease and I'd much rather not take the chance. Bye bye Aleve"
"I have recently been prescribed Naproxen for shoulder pain whilst waiting for an x-ray and scan. However I have decided to stop taking them as I am experiencing a constant dull ache on the right side of my stomach and I am also constipated and passing alot of wind. Having read some of the reviews, I am glad I haven't been taking Naproxen for long. I have shoulder pain but now have other problems because of Naproxen!!!!"
"have been taking this for three months now and have decided to stop taking it- i think i convinced myself that it was helping with my pain because I paid to see a private physician who prescribed it for me. I have been nauseous and miserable probably since i first took it. Im going to see how i feel over the next few days without taking it, I'll pro go back to Ibuprofen in the interim. Will post another review in a week to give a fair judgement."
"I pulled my back and my doctor prescribed me naproxen 500mg to take twice a day, initially it was ok but after a day I experienced heart burn, and stomach pain (especially when I ate). Stomach pain is a side effect it says so on the packaging so I thought I could bare with the stomach ache until my back was better. However, I can not seem to sleep I don’t want to take it at night before bed anymore and use a different pain killer. I’m writing this at 5:45am because I physically can not fall into a deep sleep. It does help with pain but please be aware of these side effects. I took these to also help me sleep through my pain but instead it gets rid of pain but I can not sleep."
"I was prescribed naproxen 500mg for twice a day cause I had developed costochondritis after the first 2 days of taking it I felt very drowsy, tired, dizzy, lightheaded, nausea and stomach pains after a few days went on after it I felt better but started getting more pain in my stomach and was having increased heart palpitations and bad heartburn as well as difficult sleeping I wouldn’t recommend you take this if your prone to side effects like I am but it does help that pain a lot."
"Over the past few years, I’ve been having numbness in my face and hand, eyes and feeling of pressure in my head. I’ve been to multiple neurologists had multiple mri scans of head, neck and spine which were all clear. Been prescribed so many drugs with mild improvement. Suffered serious pain in my foot a few months ago and visited a wall in clinic. I was prescribed naproxen 500mg twice daily. Which not only removed the foot pain but improved all my other symptoms. Didn’t really put the improvements to my neck pain and other symptoms to this drug. Having stopped taking this drug a couple of days all my pains are back, had headache ever since I stopped this drug. Naproxen is the best drug I’ve ever taken!!"
"Prescribed to reduce inflammation caused by pulled muscle causing chest pain, instead caused swollen glands and in some cases increased chest pain"
"I had swelling and mild pain in my arm after receiving an IV when I had a sinus infection a few weeks ago. My doctor prescribed me Naproxen and the pain has gone away but I've been experiencing pretty bad depression. The past few days I've been too tired to do anything, have lost interest in everything and have felt lower than I have in SO long. I wasn't sure what it was from until I remembered it's been this way since the exact day that I started taking the drug. I never want to take it again."
"Woke up with severe toothache early hours of friday morning and couldn't sleep, got this from thr doctor friday morning and tge first tablet eased the toothache. Taken 4 more since and not only do I now have toothache as they have stopped working but I also have severe discomfort in my stomach and am curled up in a ball and more than likely wont be sleeping tonight because of the pain. These tablets shouldn't even be prescribed. I even asked the doctor if they caused any side effects..."
Had acute gout took naproxen and within a few hours felt a lot better had no stomach issues or other side effects so well pleased I can walk again !
"I was prescribed these tablets for migraines. As much as they helped my migraines, the side effects were not so fun. I was left constantly tired and feeling drowsy - falling asleep at my desk at work and by the end of the week I had a horrible stomach ache and heartburn, which led me to stop taking them! These drugs can be so dangerous if you are NOT careful. Also, doctors should give you a warning before hand!!"
Miracle at relieving pain but I believe it gave me diahrea and stomach issues. Had to stop.
"Took this for debilitating menstrual cramps, the pain I experienced before taking Naproxen would leave me unable to move for around 4 hours, dizzy and unable to think at all and crying from pain no matter how many Ibuprofen I took. Naproxen generally sorts this pain right out, it is fast acting and for the first 6 months of taking it (only during the first and second days of my period) completely got rid of the pain. The last month or two that I have been taking it I have noticed a dull ache in my lower back despite having taken Naproxen but this generally goes away after a few hours. All in all it has helped me hugely and my periods are never a problem as long as I keep them with me. Would 100% recommend for anyone struggling with Dysmenorrhea!"
"I've taken Naproxen for both lower back pain and pain resulting from a knee injury. It works so well, it makes Ibuprofen seem useless. In addition, I've been lucky not to suffer any side effects."
"I have been taking Naproxen off-and-on for over 40 years. I have hyper-extension which caused osteoarthritis, which I've had since my teens. As long as I stayed on cycle (2x daily, same time) my pain level was minimal. However, age is taking its toll, and I now have to supplement the naprosyn with tylenol & pot, especially during weather-related flare ups. I'll have my knee(s) replaced when the combination of all 3 no longer controls the pain & aches."
Started taking naproxen when I discovered I had lower back pain that ran down my right leg. Most likely a herniated disc. It worked to reduce the inflammation and it took alot of the pain away. I feel like it works better than ibuprofen but how much better I cant say.
"Been taking Naproxen now for 3 days for very painful sciatica. Does nothing for the pain, and has given me nausea, dizziness, diarrhoea, cramps, and I’ve actually been so depressed since taking it. I don’t want to get out of bed and I’m a fit active guy. On top of that the first day I work up to approx 15 hives over my body, like mosquito bites. All that to deal with now on top of the sciatica. Cheers doc"
Gives terrible stomach pain after only a few uses
"No real side effects other than some light headedness but after taking hydrocodon it soon faded. This is good for mild pain. But if you have spinal stenosis, and chronic pain at 26y/o like me this won't really help. This is just extra strength alleve. So obviously an NSAID with a kick will catch you off guard. Not dangerous unless your liver is shot and you shouldn't be taking Tylenol anymore."
"Was prescribed 500mg of Naproxen 2x a day for pain in my back and pain in my lower stomach/pelvis while we wait for my ultrasound appointment to (hopefully) find out what’s wrong. Took one pill about 36 hours ago. Have had the shits since then. I would rather deal with what feels like a tractor rolling across my back and the stabbing pain over my ovaries, than deal with having the shits THAT bad. I’ll stick to heating pads and crying!"
"This drug is potentially dangerous. I was prescribed this as an alternative to Ibuprofen after a 4th right hip joint operation in October 2017. Within a couple of days I was suffering severe constipation and confusion. I stopped taking the drug. In April 2018 I had to have a Memory Assessment done (NHS)which was OK, BUT, the clinician doing my test reacted with concern when I told her about my bad experience with Naproxen as her partner had been prescribed with Naproxen and is now in a Mental (?) Care Home. This drug is a disaster and needs to be investigated SAP"
"Was prescribed it for pain after an ankle injury. It did help with the pain, but I had to stop taking it after getting a rash, similar to mosquito bites, all over the body. Looks like I'm in the ""up to 10%"" of people that get rash when taking it. Overall, still worked for the pain, until started getting secondary symptoms 3 days in."
Horrible stomach pains
this only eases the migraine just enough for you to get stuff done it does not work well to releive a full blown migraine
Took this for knee/joint pain. Helped a little for the pain but was so upsetting to my stomach that I would not take again. There are other treatments out there that don’t cause that type of stomach upset.
"Taking for severe severe pelvic floor pain while waiting for PT. Two days into this medication and it has made a huge difference. Hope it lasts. I cannot and will not tolerate opiate pain meds, although they have been offered by multiple doctors who just want to bandaid the problem. My new gyno has given me this with along with a script for pelvic PT, which I am being a total pessimist about, seems to good to be true after suffering 2 yrs with dibiliating pain after endometrial ablation. Which has worked, but has unfortunately caused my pelvic area to basically give up on me ! I do take this with Prilosec or the equivalent as is can cause stomach distress. So far that has not been an issue. As I said, I hope this relife lasts as it help me get through my daily routines without spending the day in bed feeling useless."
"Love it, has helped with mestrual pain. I have been have a great pain while in my period. I take Naproxen and it only takes about 5 minutes before pain is completely gone. Pain was awful but has bee well manage with Naproxen."
"Injured my occipital neuralgia (rear neck) muscle. Had severe headaches. Dr. prescribed ""naproxen"" which was giving my health away to the devil. Naproxen never assisted the neck muscle nor relieved the neck pain, but the horrible side effects are now taking me 9 months to recover my health. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEVIL DRUG. IT DESTROYS YOUR EXCELLENT HEALTH."
"Prescribed due to severe pain in knee. After 4 or 5 days, pain reduced somewhat to at least bearable levels when walking. However stools had turned black, blood pressure went up, had stomach pain/bloating and frequent urination. Worst side effect however was the rash/hives and the itching, first on both lower legs, then on stomach and then inner arms. I then went online to check potential sides effects and discovered that the above are listed. Worst yet, I checked Naproxen drug interactions with my existing prescriptions (heart and blood pressure meds) and found that there is a ""serious"" interaction with my Lisinopril and ""significant"" interactions with two other meds I am taking. I immediately stopped the Naproxen and within 3 or 4 days, things returned to normal. I will be having a serious discussion with my PCP for not warning me of the interactions and the potential side effects."
Chronic back pain- Only think that works
"Been taking naproxen for two years for chronic back pain. It works I would not be without it. I also take pregabalin at night to relieve pain whilst sleeping. That works great. It is necessary to have a gastro resistant tablet first thing to relieve any stomach issues, if I don't take that firstly then I do get stomach cramps throughout the day when taking the naproxen. Overall, I am happy with them."
"I suffer with chronic Lupus, and would hurt everyday, when my doctor prescribed me with this, let me tell you, I feel much better, my bones don't hurt like they use to"
"First night taking naproxen 500mg for ankle and back pain. Did work ankle but not the back pain. Also, horrible stomach pain and heart burn. I'm not sure if it's worth taking another dose....Not doing it."
"I've been taking 500mg of Naproxen twice daily for arthritic knee pain. Some days I had difficulty walking, but am now able to function on an almost normal level. Varying reviews here, so I would recommend to definitely try this drug to see if it benefits your specific condition."
No relief of pain as I could take a placebo and get the some relief. Luckily no side effects.
Prescribed 550 mg for back pain. I'm a 57 for male. Absolutely not effective and caused an upset stomach. Would not recommend. Ibuprofen much more effective.
I had been taking naproxen for 15 years my kidneys are damaged l don't know way my Doctor kept me on this drug if it was going to cause this kind of damage to my body is there a lawsuit pending in the courts for Naproxen
"Been taking for 18 months,was told not to take ibuprofen,but,took at night so I could sleep. Naproxen had little,or no affect on pain!"
Have taken when I get back pain always works in reducing pain for me.
"IN a day pain was almost gone from shoulder, and swelling is gone down. Works for me."
"I actually took it for a cracked rib but the dropdown box didn't show that sympton. Had been in agony for 10 days difficulty deep breathing, the doctor prescribed Naproxen and it was like a miracle, 15 minutes after taking the first tablet I felt much much better, no side effects either."
It doesn't work im still in pain
"I have been taking Naproxen, for arthritis pain, for more years than I can remember. I have also been prescribed other drugs to counteract the possible stomach effects but had to stop all of those due to bad reactions; so far I've experience no side effects at all from the Naproxen (500mg/day usually without food as I don't eat breakfast but do have a triple espresso). I've tried reducing/quitting but the pain comes back after a day or two - the Naproxen doesn't remove the pain but does make it manageable. I simply can't function without it. I have arthritis in both knees (sports injuries plus 5 menisectomies), in both hands, wrists, elbows and shoulders. I heartily recommend Naproxen."
"Swelling to my knee after an injury. Extreme heartburn after four days. Cant sleep as heartburn keeps me awake at night, cant rest knee as per doctors advise, as i feel im going to vomit due to heartburn. Have stopped using and made another appointment to see my GP. What a waste of time and resources."
Too many side effects and and pain anyways
Too many side effects and and pain anyways
"No known side effects... I have RA although am able to function reasonably well most of the time, I have Naproxen for days /timez when I need extra help and it does help to relieve my discomfort so I am very grateful!"
I have arthritis in my knees which causes severe pain and difficulty walking. This drug helps extremely well.
In a minor car accident. Was prescribed co-codamol for whiplash and was off my face and out of it for a week. Went back to doctor and got this. Absolute wonder drug. I am still myself but pain is relieved. Bliss.
I had no Release. Of Choncic Pain. Not Recommended
"My doctor prescribed this medicine for me because I get very bad period cramps. So far, Naproxen has done me nothing good but gives me very bad heartburns and pain in my stomach. Every time my stomach is hungry, it's painful. I'd recommend taking a different painkiller if you have stomach and heartburn issues."
"Alleve and generic alleve are utterly useless when you take 1-2 pills, the recommended dose. Other than tearing up your stomach it does nothing at all. Ibuprofen or arthritis Tylenol do far better."
"I suffer from severe chronic pain caused by three herniated discs. Alongside my other prescription pain killers I was also prescribed Naproxen 500Mg 2x a day. Naproxen does reduce my pain about 3-4hrs but it gives me very bad heartburn, indigestion in the morning and loose bladder. The side effects are not worth the relief this medication gives me. I take it with food and even a zantac yet it still gives me very bad heartburn that takes 4-5 days to go away."
"I was prescribed 375mg 2x day (taken with food) for severe dog bites on my arm. Within an hour, the horrible radiating pain I was feeling subsided. The next day, the pain was completely gone. Very effective if taken correctly."
My doctor prescribed this for my menstrual cramps due to me having bad bad pains from a iud paragard symptoms. I also use it for bad back pains but it doesn't work at all it doesn't even take the edge off. I take 2 500mg and still nothing. Motrin 800 works better for me but it is not good on the stomach.
"I took this for coping with severe pain from muscle strain in lower back, shoulder and neck. I found that sometimes taking it in the day gave me nausea but at night no problem. And ensured a pain free good nights sleep. Very effective at dealing with pain."
"Horrible experience. Nausea. Headache. Bloody stool. Drowsy. And on top of all that, it didn't even help my knee pain."
"It comes right back out. I've never had vomiting from any pill, but Naproxen I swallow, then vomit, it doesn't stay inside my stomach. No idea if it is effective on pain, I have tried it several times for different sorts of pain (headache, knee pain) and each time I have vomited it right back out. This is the only medicine this has happened with, and it's happened 100% of the times I have tried it."
Proscribed for acute bone and bladder pain from Prostate cancer. after one day the pain was gone and i could sleep. Still taking it two weeks later with excellent results
"Useless. Does not help with chronic shoulder pain, yet that's all the doctors prescribe..."
"Don't take or prescribe this medicine! , i was prescribed naproxen 500 mg twice a day for headache neck and stomach pain and i must say this drug is terrible! it made my stomach condition worse when i took it! why is this stuff even prescribed. if i wanted this garbage id go buy it otc"
"Took Naproxen after injuring the tendons in my foot. Helped tremendously with the pain and didn't experience any of the side effects some people have mentioned here (although my GP did warn that a small number of people will do). I guess everyone is different but that's why the possible side effects are listed on the leaflet in the box! I, for one, would recommend Naproxen."
"I've been using Naproxen for a year now to help with my chronic migraines. I take 1 tablet (500mg) every time I have or feel like i'm about to get a migraine and it completely stops it. Before Naproxen, I tried every otc and herbal medicine to help combat debilitating migraines that were progressively getting worst. Some days, I wouldn't even be able to get out of bed because of how bad my migraines were. The last straw was when I was hit with a migraine while I was shopping at Walgreens. The lights were so bright, everything was moving, I felt nauseous, and the only thing I could do was sit and cover my eyes and wait for the migraine to subside. Ever since taking Naproxen, I have not expererience an episode like that. I now get migraines less than 2 or 3 times a month. Compared to getting them on the daily basis. I have experienced no side effects."
"Been on this for many years on & off, I only take as needed. I have degetive disc disease since I was 15 (mid 30's now) form an biking accident, 2 herniated L4/L5 disc, had surgery on them 15 years ago (helped a lot with siatica but did not eliminate it). Hit by a car once and 3 other bad bicycle accidents. I take Tylenol, Vicodin & Valium all as needed besides naproxen, also take other daily meds for a gland problem that I will die with out them The bads; YOU MUST EAT before taking, eat reasonable amount a food, a bit of bread will not cut it, eat the full slice of bread or tall glass of whole milk. It takes at lease a hour while for it to START to work. Pros: it does help if taken right for the right pain, it will not get rid of mussel spasms. It does help when you inflammatory problems or swelling like in knee or week right after you brake a bone (yes it helped with the swelling in my foot right after on top a Vicodin) This has cut my use of Vicodin in half or greater, I take this maybe 4 times a week, Vicodin maybe 3-8 times a month (fall & spring the worse months for me) before napexson I was taking 6-10+ Vicodin a month. This is not some magic pill it a help,"
1st pill a slept directly after taken in the middle of that day until lately night ! After 3 days more back pain after 1 week heart muscle pain and stomach lot of sleep even depressive ! I stop it after 10 days stay away from it!!
"Please remember ulcers will happen if you take pills on empty stomachs, always eat something small before. This is the only pain medication i can take that actually relieves my back pain in my lower lumbar."
"The pain stopped completely. However, the medicine taken at 1/2 strength still raised my blood pressure and upset my stomach."
"Doctor put me on Naproxen 500mg to take two tablets twice a day. A week later I was in the back of an ambulance onroute to A&E. Now i have a very irregular heartbeat, ringing in my ears, feel very dizzy when standing and walking. Naproxen has wrecked me, that's the best way to describe how I now feel. NEVER EVER TAKE NAPROXEN!"
"I went to the emergency room with "" BLEEDING ULCERS "" due to 600mg 1 X 3times a day 1/2013! I TELL EVERYONE I KNOW TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS MEDICINE!"
I had terrible aches from the flu and I took one pill in the morning and my body didn't hurt the rest of the day! It's great!
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Took 2 500mg pills(I stand 6'2 225 lbs) & havent slept in a day & a half. Feet are so swollen, i can't put shoes on. Painful to even stand. Haven't taken p00p in 2 days (normally 2X daily). Constant hiccups for hours, & developing a rash on my back. Whatever pain you have, DO NOT USE NAPROXEN, TRY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!"
"after only 5 days of taking them,for sciatica, my feet and hands swelled up and I had to take off my rings and was unable to wear shoes after stopping them, it took another 3 days for the swelling to go down also I could not concentrate and could not sleep while on them."
"Fever, a throat infection needing a dose of antibiotics no appetite for three days, all because I took one table."
"Had severe joint pain in both wrist with swelling, pain was so bad I couldn't move my fingers. Within 4 hours after taking Naproxen (500mg) I was able to move my fingers and wrist, after a second dose, about 10 hours later, the pain continued to subside and was felling better in a day."
"I never have been so sick in my life after taking one pills. Stomach pains, heart burn, nausea, body aches. I thought I was going to die. Be careful of this drug! Naproxen 500mg tab"
"I would only recommend this for nerve pain, its useless for period pain and back pain."
"My menstrual cramps were always accompanied by severe lower back pain and could be quite debilitating before I discovered Aleve/naproxen; from then on, I've always used naproxen for about one week out of every month. If you follow the dosing instructions, there shouldn't be a problem. It usually says to not exceed 3 tablets in a 24 hour period. That means every 12 hours you alternate between 2 tablets and 1 tablet, or you could take 1 tablet every 8 hours. I usually use the former configuration, and it works way better for me than acetaminophen. I usually buy the largest quantity bottle I can find, and since I only use it 12 weeks out of the year, that averages about $24 a year give or take a few bucks."
"I had pelvic surgery and the oxycodone would only deal with the pain for about 4 hours, and the instructions were to take every 6 hours. I tried advil but gave no relief. The nurse suggested to try this. Did not help with the pain but within 24 hours my ENTIRE body ITCHED!!! 7 days later I still itch, now I have to take antihistimeans and steroids to try and stop itching."
I was prescribed this treatment when I visited my GP and he diagnosed a condition called plantar fasciitis which I suffered from last year. I finished my course of this drug but still had the pain. I found some more of this tablet from my previous prescription and started taking them again. I am still in pain even whilst taking them and have got permanent heartburn/indigestion but cannot take indigestion remedies with them as they are not allowed at the same time. I can no longer go running as the day after I am in immense pain and it hurts to walk on my foot.
"Im 29 years old, male, had an excrutiating dental pain, was prescribed this medicine, and the pain NEVER went away. I felt like the PAIN was killing me, had me crying of PAIN! I took 2 pills thinking it could work faster, but NO, NO pain relief! Went to the ER, HAD TO WALK OUT BECAUSE they were no dentists to help me at the time. After hours of this PAIN, the pain started to subside, but the tingling and numbness in my body started..... a funny strange feeling all over.....PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION, I was not informed that this medication was time release, or the side effects of this pill. Its a damn shame that patients have to do research on meds before taking them, unfortunately there is no money back! I flushed the pills after reading the interactions..."
I was prescribed this yesterday started treatment today with it. I feel no difference in pain level. I have a torn meniscus and torn ligaments in my right knee as well as bone fragments floating around in there. I took just one pill and my whole system is messed up from it. It is interfering with other medications that I take for Migraines and Asthmatic Medications. I would not recommend this medication to anyone at all. If it worked it would be different but it don't work at all. And difinately don't take it if you are on crutches and have it give you the shits cause you would never get to the restroom on time. I hate having any medication give me the roaring shits.

"Very efective with osteoarthritis pain and trochanter hip bursitis pain, but caused ringing in my ears. I took over the counter generic naproxen sodium two 220 mg pills twice daily. Reasonably priced."
"My doctor prescribed it to me after I injured my shoulder in a minor car accident, and previous medications weren't helping. I haven't noticed a lot of change with this either, and I've been feeling more anxious and having more headaches than usual."
"After taking for several years, I developed kidney disease which is a side effect of taking naproxen. It helped the arthritic pain, but left me with another problem."
"I bent over and immediately felt a sharp pain in my lower back. I have been hurting for 3 weeks. Doc gave me Tramadol which did nothing to ease the pain, then gave me Naproxen and I can't tell I've even taken anything, even when I take twice the suggested dose. This medicine is worthless !!"
Have costochondritis. 2 times a day for 6 weeks with prilosec.
My dr prescribed this for me when I complained about a muscular pain in my shoulder. I took 1 tablet twice a day for two weeks as stated by my dr but it did absolutely nothing to help. I left it for a while and then I went back to my dr on 25th Sept. He prescribed another two weeks of them and referred me for some physiotherapy. At the moment I still cannot feel any difference. I have a slight side effect this time but nothing major.I do find them very difficult to swallow even if I break them in half.
"I have had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis for about 2-3 years. I took Naproxen 375MG tablets to help with it when I first was diagnosed with JRA and it did help at that point. After, they put me on methotrexate and folic acid, which helped and then after about a year or so, I was doing fine and was eased off of all methods of medication. Now, it seems as if my JRA has came back; so I have just recently been put back on Naproxen. Most likely, it was the methotrexate that didn't work. The naproxen I think, did in fact, help a bit more."
"I was prescribed this after dental surgery to help with inflammation, I'm unsure whether it helped with the inflammation as had to stop taking as had an adverse reaction with breathing difficulties and vomiting blood over a 5 hour period also 2 days after stopping I am still having problems with my skin burning up. Dosage 500mg x 2 per day, taken over 3 days, total prescribed 50"
I have been taking 1 500 mg naproxen per day for several years and have had no side effects and it has helped very much with arthritis and spinal stenosis discomfort.
Worked well for dulling the pain during a flare. It didn't upset my stomach anywhere near as much as Ibuprofen.
was having headaches for 5 days straight and advil was relieving the pain. My doc gave me some of these and within a hour i had alot of relief.
"I had, had a long period of shoulder trouble, aches and pains with fully extended movement. The doctor prescribed 2 naproxen,( 500mg per day ) even though I had previously had an ulcer !(granted it was a long time ago ). The day after taking the first tablets my joint pain reduced significantly, however, I had severe stomach pains, that I didn't immediately associate with the tablets. I've now stopped taking them but my stomach hasn't yet recovered. I definately won't be taking any more !!! I'd rather put up with the pain of my shoulder, than destroy my stomach lining. I also take low doses of hay fever tablets, again, the doctor didn't mention NOT to use them."
Had taken it for 2 weeks - 3 times a day and face and neck broke out in really bad rash - hives looking - with blisters. it did decrease the hip pain significantly however.
"I have been in a lot of pain (tennis elbow) and was prescribed Naproxen 250 mg tabs 3 times a day. I have just finished my 4th day and my skin starting itching, my scalp, all round my neck and chest, under my breasts and even my pubic area. A short time after I was covered in huge hives and looked like a lobster. I am going to stop taking them and continue with my elbow support, this is more unbearable than the pain of my elbow."
"had a slipped disc , had surgery and went back on naproxen, was on this drug for a year and still would be on it if i wasnt admitted to hospital twice in agony, they stopped this drug and now i have several appointments as my stomach is in agony now resulting in my spine being in agony as i cant take any more medication due to this drug, while on it everything was fine i was back to work until my stomach got damaged, please be aware if your on it carefully wean of it if possible to avoid stomach issues, i now have to wait 3 weeks for a camera to see how much damage is done...good luck everyone."
I took this drug for severe leg pains. Naproxen did NOT work for this pain. Wasted doctor visit. Awake for 3 days and still in pain. Naproxen NOT for severe pain. Pharmacy instructions: TAKE TWO TABLETS DAILY FOR PAIN!
Wroks where aperin fails for pain relief
"I have taken Naproxen with breakfast (porridge and fruit) 30-60 minutes after a 30 mg dose of Lansoprazole to enhance gastro-resistance. Two weeks of 250 mg per day did give some relief, as if my knee joints and myalgic muscles had been given a spray of WD40. Then, as advised I could, I increased my dose to 500 mg per day. This, after three days, has made a significant difference to background discomfort and pain generally, although my muscles still hurt when under load, e.g. standing up. I'll try this for another three weeks, and then reduce my dose to check progress and reduce risk."
helped with no narcotic feeling :)
"It does not have any immediate effectiveness for the pain of migraines, nor does it eliminate or decrease the accompanying symptoms of migraine (aura, nausea, problems hearing, dizziness, etc.), however, I have not found ANY medications that do that. I prefer Naproxen because it elminates the long term effects of migraines, meaning: about 5-8 hours after taking it I won't have any lingering pain or weariness."
"Since starting this medication I have experienced extreme stomache pain and swelling. Continous hickups, burning acid pain. I have also taken omaprezol twice daily which is suppose to releive these symptoms but I have not found them helpful. I would not recommend them...The dose of naproxen I take is 500mg twice daily for Fybromyalgia. Although I must say they do help for the fybromyalgia I am wondering if the side effects are just to much."

"My GP suggested that as I had been taking Arthrotec 75 for a number of years that I should change my medication for Naproxen 500mg tablets twice a day. Within a day of taking Naproxen I had the most tremendous headache, nausea & vomting. I persevered for 4 & 1/2 days & by then I thought my head would explode. I have stopped taking Naproxen & will be returning to my GP. Naproxen did nothing for my back & joint pain & gave me the worse headache ever, I certainly will not be taking Naproxen again."
"I am 25 year old female. I have arthritis in my right shoulder and bicep tendinitis. I was prescribed naproxen and took it once, 1 pill 500mg. That night i took it I had headache and severe nausea but no vomiting. The next morning I had a 2 inch hive on my cheek. I have never been allergic to anything or suffered side affects from any drug. I have kidney stenosis which cause my blood pressure to rise sometimes but haven't been having any issues with hypertension in months. Other than that I am in good health and physically fit."
I'm 60 years old and was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)in my mid 20's. 500 mg naproxen taken twice a day has by far been the most effective treatment of my condition. Care must be taken to limit alcohol use and take medication with food (to prevent stomach bleeding) but by and large it's nearly side effect free and has provided long lasting relief from inflamtion and pain associated with AS
I highly recommend this product to anyone because I have not experienced any side effects and the pain ease instantly
I took Naproxen for dysmenorrhea. After two hors of intake i culd augh with others. This was my second time taking it for that and it worked perfectly for me. The only thing i noticed is that my flow stopped as well. I was happy because i could not tolerate the pains any longer.
I was prescribed this medication 3 days ago for shoulder/joint pain and I still have to take 25mg of Benadryl at night to knock me out otherwise I'm up all night from the pain. I eat before I take it and still have a burning sensation in my stomach.
"Morphine Sulphate didn't even make a dent on my gout pain, so I can't blame Naproxen. Probably works for ""normal"" pain. Colchicine eventually worked somewhat, at the expense of my GI tract. Prednisone seemed to work the best, but it too took a few days to kick in (sure beats 6 or more months nonstop severe gout agony). One can't rely on Prednisone all the time for obvious reasons. Generic, 500mg, tried it for a few months."
I have chronic pain in my wrist and naproxen does not help.
"Minor stomach upset, but can be solved with food at time of taking pill."
"I am taking over-the-counter Naproxen, 220 mg x 2 a day and it has been amazingly effective on my tendinitis. My range of motion in my should is pretty much back to normal and so far, no stomach upsets. I am not expecting any upsets with such a low dose. I also have a ""total gym"" that I work out on to strengthen my muscles so I have no need to go to physical therapy. Personally, I think that strength exercises and a low dose of Naproxen is the answer to pain relief for tendinitis."
"I was in a car accident, I was prescribed this for Bursitis in my shoulder joint. It helped alot. I got my RX filled at wal-mart cost $8.00"
"I've been having joint pain in my right hip and knee for the better part of three months now and have only recently gone to my doctor to be checked out. We are still unsure of the cause as there is no inflammation and my x-rays and bloodwork checking for rheumatoid came back normal. Not only am I frustrated with this mystery joint pain, it is equally as frustrating being prescribed this medication, as it doesn't even touch the pain that I am in. The only benefit I believe is that the side effects distract me a tad from the pain. Because the side effects are horrendous. Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, headaches, ugh! Never in my life have I had so many problems with any other medication."
My left knee is rubbing bone to bone. Have no insurance-went to the doctor(ER) to get some help-not much help eventhough I work hard hours(12TO15 hrs) a day. As for the product it has worked well.....

"1 of a second set of wisdom teeth is shifting around in my gums. No place to really move. Extreme pain, unable to eat. after taking two naproxen 500 mg, no extreme pain, still uncomfortable, but able to eat one hour after dosing."
I was prescribed Naproxen for muscel spazam. It did not work for me at all. The pain continued.
My doctor decided around 1 month ago that i had been taking my last Nsid for 2 long and was worried about the effects on my stomach ect it was diclofenac sodium 100mg once per day as well as 1-2 tarmadol and 2-4paracetamol and was keeping me pretty pain free. I am sad to say i cannot say the same for this pill 500mg twice per day as well as tramadol and paracetamol and have an appointment with my GP to tell her so I am now having to take up to 8 paracetamol per day and 4 tramadol and am not as pain free as i was while i appreciate that arthritis is a degenerative condition it does not go downhill that fast surely?
I had a baby 7 weeeks ago by via c section and the cramps during my first menstral were horrable not to mention my toothace to put the iceing on the cake.. I take two 275Mg and the pain is gone in about 30 min..
good for anti - inflamation
"I DO HAVE MIGRANES NOT OFFTENLY, BUT PERHAPHS TWICE A MONTH, AND NOT EVEN IMITREX WERE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT."
IT WORKS TRY IT FOR YOURSELF SEE WHAT YOUR DOCTOR IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS MEDICINE TAKE JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR HAVE SET UP FOR U DON'T OVER DOSE IT
"I was having very bad pain from a fibroid cyst on my uterus. It was hurting me most during menses. I have tried other perscription pain medications and they did not work. I was told it wouldn't work right away but it did. I only take one and ""Voila"", no pain! I tried heating packs and everything and this pain was so excruciating sometimes I would just cry out loud. Now, I can't believe it, the pain is gone."
"I consider Naproxen the generic for Aleve, so I think the price is very reasonable. I'm a runner in my early 60's and have found Naproxen to ease my recovery after distance running (anything over 5 miles). Weekly I run a total of 15 to 20 miles, and usually take one tablet shortly after running my longer distances, which is twice a week, usually Saturday and Wednesday. For me, it is nearly a miracle pain reliever, easing what can be painful arthritis in my ankles and knees."
I can't really tell much about it yet. I have been on this one month along with a lot of other medication as I have just recently chnged doctors. I am a diabetic and we are treating bad neuropathy in feet and legs.
"I have had rheumatoid arthritis since 1998. Been on Remicade Infusion every 8 weeks since mid 1999 - still had quite a bit of pain but it helped. My Orthopaedic doctor recommended Naproxin and gave me Rx for it. It relieved the pain on the first pill. Rheumatologist had even suggested hip replacement, I DON'T THINK SO!! Plan to discontinue remicade infusion and use Naproxin exclusively."
"After taking 1 each, 375 mg, tablet of Naproxen, I noticed the aches and pains in my neck and back were relieved! The relief lasted aproximately, 2-3 days! DO NOT take this product on an empty stomach, and make sure to have your doctor aware of what other medications you take prior to taking Naproxen. Lastly, make sure you tell your Dr. what ""herbals and vitamins"" you also take!! Keep a personal record of when you took what medications, quantity and when. Divassa"
I have lower back pain and I noticed a big difference the very next day
I found this to be completely ineffective. It did absolutely nothing to ease the discomfort in my hips and was very expensive. I would not recommend it.
Really doesn't provide much relief from the pain and for sure does not reduce the intesity of a gout attack nor does it reduce the leangth of time the inflamation is present.
I got slight stomach problems but was feeling much better.
Lower back pain and hip pain was relieved quickly both while I played golf and afterwards on another occasion. I have only used the product two or three times. I have taken 2 of the little blue OTC tablets on each occasion.
I have stage I and II osteoarthritis and I have used a few different anti-inflamatorys and pain relievers and NONE have worked as well. Thank you for this wonderful product.
"it really helps my knee pain,some stomach irritation but the relief is worth it."
has'nt really work on me still having pain
works for me quickly
"Works well for headaches,arthritis"
"If I take the anaprox, I find that I can go for 12 to 15 hours without having to take ant Tylenol for pain.  I try to use it as little as possible because it aggravates my sensitive stomach.  Years ago, it was my “only” relief for the severe pain of endometriosis!  This was a Godsend medication for that debilitating pain!"
sticking with tylenol.
I have used since 16 w/ bad knee. Had knee replaced 4 years ago. Originally was prescription.

naproxen takes all my sciatica pain away for about 8+ hours . Couldn't be any happier getting back into the gym without pain .
Doesn't take all the pain away and make me very sleeply.
I took it for a serious pain in my right arm but other than making me sleep nothing got better if not worse. I never had such pain like in the morning after taking it. I’m talking about only four hours after taking in the pain gets so bad that I’m not taking it again since I suspect if it can’t make things worse.  Best case it helps nothing 
I think it is a placebo.
"A DO prescribed 500mg of this drug for me to ""just try it and see if it works"", while he was looking right at my medical record showing that I'm on a daily aspirin regimen that cannot be stopped.  You cannot mix aspirin and naproxen.  I ditched him and this prescription, with my pharmacist's agreement."
I have a fractured rib and clavicle. The clavicle is going to need surgery in order to have it repaired. I was prescribed Percocet when I was released from the emergency room. Unfortunately I went back to my doctor (nurse practitioner) and she decided to prescribe this garbage for my pain. Thank God for the sleeping effect. Can't wait to meet with the orthopedic surgeon might have a clue what kind of pain I'm in. Why are there suits against the drug companies not against the doctors with regards of the opioid crisis? It's the doctor's responsibility determine what is right and what is wrong for the patient not the drug company. Take some f****** responsibility. Yeah they're going to under prescribe to make up for it - losers.
"I have fibromyalgia and was prescribed naproxen and an antidepressant. The naproxen doesn't completely relieve the pain, but it does take the edge off and allow me to do most things I want to do. It doesn't make me sleepy. I have had a problem with intestinal bleeding with the naproxen and have had to stop taking it for periods of time."
i have had pain since i was 13 from a car accident i was on a bike when hit .recently these people assulted me and stuff and i was perscribed this by the hospital. i was hit in the left jaw with a metal gun barrel and i have t.m.j. in my left jaw getting away i suffered a dental injury on my bottom right jaw area. but on a daily basis i have back rib chest and neck pain from the accident when i was 13 problem. at the hospital i was prescribed this medication and 3 days later zilch nothing its completely ineffective for any pain at all. it made me sluggish and tired and that's it. i get migraines from a subdural hematoma to daily.  no effect. for high levels of pain and serious permanent injuries or dental pain or t.m.j. wont help at all.
"I am a 24 year old male with 2 herniated disks on my lower back with multiple disk degeneration on several other disks from mostly military injuries. Pain ranges from 6 to 9 on the pain scale some days are worse then others, I was prescribed 500mg Naproxen twice a day with meals and this medication does absolutely nothing for me."
After trying various medicines for back pain this really worked for me. I've had three back surgeries and It's good to have it around.
"My dr prescribed me this as well as physical therapy when my low back pain became where I couldn't walk, talk or concentrate.  The pills just made me feel exhausted they make great sleeping pill for when you really need some good rest,.. or Anti anxiety drug .....I told doc I didn't want drugs which harm my body and give me side effects. Im not a risk/benefit type who gambles with my body. He said he would never hurt me. Alas he's a resident and not very experienced with the fact that Big Pharmaceutical corporates aren't mandated to TELL the doctors all the truth."
"In the doses I was prescribed, it works for 150 minutes while you can only take the pills every 240 minutes. This meant that in order to get to sleep I would have to time it out or suffer somewhat through the day so I could go to bed with fully effective Naproxen. This was on 1250MG. ![The 150 minutes became less over time, as bad as 65 minutes]!

ease of use, well, obviously. Clench it between your teeth, drown it with water. Very easy to use and swallow due to it's shape.

Now you see 4 stars for effectiveness and 5 stars for Ease of Use so you may wonder why my overall satisfaction is 1 star. In my case, beastly side effects.

- The effectiveness went down as time went on, the toll it took on my digestive system and stomach lining didn't. Perhaps even mild compounding effect.

- My Stomach was not happy with it and signaling is still bad (I no longer know when/if I'm hungry)

- Caused a lot of stomach bleeds, combined with the side-effect of being somewhat slow, I've gotten to experience a few near death experiences in the morning by almost choking on my [regurgitated] blood. Now it's a rare side-effect so it took a few close calls for it to be found.

- It numbed far more than just the pain. Can't finish the memory, lose track in the middle of a sentence, sudden onset of sleepiness. I had to choose health or work because this medication didn't allow me both. It went quiet in my head and gave me loopy dreams.

- I have stopped taking it and the effects on my sleeping rhytm, stomach function and brain communication can still be noticed months after.

-----
BOTTOM LINE:

Use no more than needed, hide it away (so you don't go take more with a cloudy head) And I would seriously advice against prolonged use if you have ANY alternative. It's initial effectiveness is addictive. It really is a drug. (The ""Don't do drugs kids!"" kind)"
Did NOTHING or if I was lucky . . . next to NOTHING!!!

Dr subscribed for lower back pain when needed. First pill pain was gone. only had to take 2 or so in the last 3 weeks. Works fine for me.
Naproxen caused me to have 3hr nose bleeds multiple times.  It really thins blood.
"Originally prescribed for when I tore some tendons, I've continued to use it on and off ( I have so much leftover).   If I get really sore and have trouble sleeping this helps me out a lot.  I usually pair it with robaxin for muscle pain.  It's also fantastic for severe headaches. "
I had tremendous stomach pain worse than I experienced using Aspirin. The bleeding stomach was so painful that I couldn't feel any pain relief. Tylenol works best for me. Safe and comfortable as Tylenol it literally looses your blood vessels to make your blood easier to flow through your body. Avoid Aleve.
"I was on 800 mg. Motrin for about 25 years for arthritis in my lower back and neck. My Dr. decided that I needed to switch things up and move to something less harsh on my stomach. I have been taking Naproxen 500mg. for nearly 5 years now. It worked, it was easy on my system until about 3 weeks ago and I began to have unbearable pain in my chest, left arm, left neck, and left shoulder blade. Thought I was having a heart attack! Emergency room visit, EKG was normal, labs normal, (however cholesterol 560), but that's another Springer show. "
Took my pain away a felt great with the pain I was having.
I get tummy pain from it but it helps with the pain 
"I am a 28 year old woman.  I have Ankylosing Spondylitis.  (Arthritis)...  My doc is about tostart me on Infusions, but until then he decided to have me take Naproxen 500 with Tramodol..  I've been taking the Tramodol for almost a year now.  When I started the Naproxen with it, SO MUCH of my pain and stiffness were gone!  I thought I'd found a miracle...  but 3 days in and my stomach was all messed up!  I couldn't use the bathroom, nauseated and gagging constantly.  Very miserable experience.  Apparently this medication can cause stomach problems!  I'll NEVER take this drug again, it was so bad! Remember, everyone is different, good luck & God Bless!"
"I just had a hysterectomy and a large tumor taken off my intestine along with 10""  of intestine and was prescribed this drug. Did not take it till a week or so after release from hospital for incision site burning sensation. Incision-pain did not cease and all Naproxin gave me was NEW symptoms exhaustion, muscle weakness, tremors in my abdomen when trying to sit up and debiltationg new back pain reminiscent of same back pain I experienced 20 years ago when I had pre-eclampsia toxemia.Numbness and tingling in fingers, hard to concentrate, dry mouth, constipation, dark stools, headache.I just threw these pills out and going to drink  plenty of water and you watch. In 3 days' time, I bet all those Naproxin-related pains will vanish. I took this to solve one symptom and wound up with like 10 new ones and original symptom not helped at ALL. Drug causes pain, does not alleviate it. In me anyhow. Drug should not be on market."
Developed a severe case of vertigo while taking.  Vertigo went away after stopping use.  Back to my favorite Advil.
"Degenerated disk in my back causing me considerable pain continuously led to me taking 500mg morning and night. 
It seems to be a side effect free and very effective pain killer for me.
I am now continuously cloudy headed, but I confidence this started at the same time as taking this. No one else seems to of mentioned this so I imagine it is unrelated.
Been taking it for 18 months+"
"took narcotic pain pills for years...hardest to wean myself off of, too. But still need help with Chronic pain.  500 mgs. twice per day is a concern, but it does take the unbearable edge off of the pain issues, so I can function throughout my day. Much more ""clarity"" of mind, as well!
"
Honestly its garbage I'm switching back to vicoprofen hydrocodones ASAP  NSAIDS ARE STUPID KILL YOU AND MILDLY EFFECTIVE AT THE LEAST
"Noted side effects after 3 or more years of use for post surgical disc repair with great results.  1. decreased blood platelets not severe  2. boarderline elevated blood glucose with Hemogloblin A-1C elevations. 3. additional use of licinopril adding concerns for false elevation of blood glucose levels 4. less use of Rx's and weight loss have noted a decreased in negative side effects (lab)5. wt.watchers dieting program and exercise of walking has added to wt loss thus far (still not at target goal for age,etc)
Summary: It appears that my personal situation with use of Rx's for pain and hypertension have temporary lab abnormalities.........wt. loss is of great value to resolution of self-inflicted hypertension and my type 2 diabetic state.
Pain relief has been accomplished with this RX Naproxen.  My prior experience with daily use of ASA 81mg presented a greater occurance of GI side effects (neg) with liver function envolvement and other lesser but noted side effects. I have a great team of MD/NP manageing my health at Sentara Hospital Systems in the Tidewater Virginia Beach,VA. area."
Lower back stress. Worked well within hours.
pain relief
"45yr old male. involved in accident at work. 4 surgeries, medication given to me for pain. took for 9 months. the result 5 ulcers. that is more pain than from surgery. been fighting ulcers for 6 months now. was informed recently surgery may be only way to correct."
"after my surgery, i was perscribed this medication for my pain. this medication has not helped me at all. would not recommend to others!!"
Muscular pain went away but numerous large red spots appeared on my lower legs.  Doctor said stop naprocyn and get checked by dermotologist.  I took only 4-5 pills
"Feel extremely nauseous taking this medication, took it with food but still felt sick every Morning.  Worked decently on joint pain."
I was prescribed this for a sprained ankle..at 500mg. Three days later i'm having bloody stools. I am also talking meds for my depression that the doc knew about!!!! Not happy!!!
"I was taking Vioxx for back pain for less than a year and developed an ulcer.  Then the Dr. prescribed Naproxen after my ulcer was repaired.  Not a good drug for me.  Naproxen started the ulcer again, major stomach pain, heartburn, and nausea at times.  I have discovered, for me, that I cannot take any kind of anti-inflammatory drug, even over the counter ibiproferin (?) will start my stomach pain again.   So maybe that could be part of the stomach problems that have been mentioned here.

When the ulcer first started with the Vioxx, my Dr. had me take all the drugs for GERD, heartburn, anything related to the stomach.  Nothing worked, after multiple tests, I finally insisted on the test where they use a camera in your stomach...sure enough, there was the ulcer!!  Stated taking ACIPHEX and it was almost instant relief!  Sometimes you have to listen to your own body.  The ins. companys would rather go with trial and error than try the best (?), more expensive drugs/ treatment and the Drs.usually go along with them.  I suffered for over a year with my stomach trying different drugs, changing my eating, etc. Even had a colonoscopy!! I finally told the Dr. ""no more crap"" and that I wanted the gastro test, and that's when I was proven right.  "
"Naproxen I descoverd is a fancy name for tylenol...

taken for hand joint pain. works fast and lasts long. very impressed. I take it sparingly. 
Prescribed this less than 24 hours ago for lower back pain 2x 500mg per day. Taken the first two it's now 3.30am and I am unable to sleep and in agony with awful heartburn and still have backache! 
"WORKED ON NECKPAIN, BUT STOCMACH PAIN GOT REALLY BAD. STOPPED TAKING 3 DAYS AGO STILL FELL SICK A LOT, HOPE ITS GOING TO STOP.
NOT WORTH THE RISK."
"The medication helps with my pain but I am having other side effects. Black stool, itchy rash in my head and cramps with bleeding."
I TOOK THIS MEDICATION WITH WATER AND IT WORKED GREAT. I TOOK THIS MEDICATION WITH ORANGE JUICE AND BROKE OUT IN HIVES ALL OVER MY BODY!!!
I was prescribed this after I fell and hurt my wrist to help with the swelling and pain.  It stops the pain and swelling but after 3 days it started causing bad diarhea.  Do not suggest this drug if you have problems taking aspirin/ibuprofen products because it causes stomach problems at high dosages. 500mg twice daily
Any time I feel pain I take 2/500mg and within half hour the pain starts going away. Great prescription!
"gives me heartburn and upset stomach, does not relieve pain"
I may have a bone spur in my left heel. The naproxen has not helped the pain at all. 
"It just takes the edge off my pain, gives me constapation(BAD). Makes me cranky and very bitchie when the medication is wearing off !  "
I found this drug to be more effective controlling my pain when taking ibuprofen along with it
Works better that any other drug I have used for pain in my knee.
"started taking naproxen for lower back pain, dr said it would help with the inflammation pain but it gave me lower abdominal pains, constipation and diarrhea and i still have lower back pain. also nausea every so often. "
"Helps with my chronic lower back pain. I take 500mg approx. 1-2 times a week as needed for pain. I am not able to do the physical activities I used to be able to do, but Naproxen does enable me to do regular daily activities without being in severe pain."
"Taking medication for arthritis. Have been on the meds for two weeks. Hands, lower arms, feet, lower legs actually feel worse (and swollen). Will quit taking and report back if pain has subsided."
Is ineffective for back pain.  Causes acid indegestion.
Although I had no conditions that would suggest I was at risk I suffered from severe abdomilal pain even after the first dose. Quit taking after 2 doses.
Helped with pain at first but caused sever constipation and abdominal pain.
Pain in extremities and teeth.
blood glucose has risen   on warfarin more INR testing
"I have been taking this med off and on for years for arthritis, it does ok. However, I started taking 550mg after being diagnosed with TMJ(TMD)It doesn't do a thing for that kind of pain. Makes it worse actually by causing some kind of jaw-clenching, shoulder tightness that I didn't notice in the past. Using plain ole aspirin and pain free now. Be carefull using high doses of this med."
caused severe dizziness and nausea. not as effective for pain relief at I expected 
I am taking this for knee pain.  My knee often swells and has pain and my doctor thinks I could have inflammation behind my knee cap.  He suggested taking this but I dont think it works very well because my knee still hurts.  I also cannot sleep when I take it.
I was using  medication for joint and muscle pain. The one thing it does not directly mention in the warning is hiatal hernia. If you have one as I do DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. After just 1 pill my legs were virtually pain free but for the misery I was in because of my stomach......it wasn't worth it
"Yep, im allergic. found out the hard way. Worked for a few days the BAM in the hospital!!"
"I developed arthritis & was put on this med. Don't expect to be pain free immediately, its not the way it works. But after you have used it for about 6 weeks, you will definitely see a difference. While I still have some restricted movement in lifting my one arm w/o pain in shoulder, I absolutely know when I have forgotten to take my pill. I am on 500mg 2x a day."
"i have several reasons why i take this medicine.arthritis,pinch nerve and gun shot wound. and most of the time it helps my pains i can take it for 3 days than i stop because i start getting ""cotton mouth"" and i hate that feeling."
"I was prescribed 500mg 2x a day for joint pain. I experienced NO pain relief and had dizziness, what felt like a racing heart, a dull headache and felt weird while taking it. Aleve and Naproxen are the same drug so that explains why I'm getting no pain relief and experiencing the same side effects of both Aleve and Naproxen. 2 Aleve's is equal to 1 500mg Naproxen."
"I'm taking this medication for a nerve-related issue.  I'm only taking 250mg twice a day and it does seem effective.  However, I do get stomach pain when I do take it with food.  I just started taking it so hopefully my body can adjust to the medication."
I got an awful headache after taking this medication.  
"Been taking this medicine for 1 week, having problems with swollen feet. Meds didn't help alot, still have pain. "
"I was first given Naproxen for back pain, I found it seemed to help more with knee pain than for the back, over time it helped with both. I started at 500mg 2 a day, about a week ago I started taking 1/2 a tab or 250mg 2 times a day and so far it seems to be okay."
"I had this medication for 25 days I had bad heartburn, stomach pain and sleepless"
boooooooooooooooooooooooo
they diagnosed me with an ovarian cyst. i have been taking thismed. for 4 days has not helped with pain what so ever!
"just starting to take this med , unknown if it is going to help or not ... will advise after 1 or 2 weeks
"
"I did feel some relief from the pain in my heel, but on the 6th day my stomac is in excrutiating pain, diarrhea."
"I was in an accident and have a neck injury, my doctor prescribed me pain pills and this to work together for pain and inflammation. I am now taking only this to manage with my pain episodes that come and go and cause me severe headaches. The things I have the most difficulty with is with stomach pain, even if I eat with it, it bothers my stomach alot to the point of where I can't even go to work some days. It also makes me tired and I yawn constantly, it does help with the pain and swelling and stops the headaches but it's a big sacrafice, I would not recommend anyone who has IBS to take this medication. I am not taking half a 500 mg pill in the morning and half at night EVERY OTHER DAY instead of a whole pill twice a day as prescribed to see if that eases up on the stomach problems, I have to also combine it with a natural supplement for IBS from digestive health, this has seemed to help me quite a bit however my stomach still is always unsettled that is my only complaint about this medication"
Taking 500 mg for lower back pain (disc) and leg pain. Only meds that work.  Make sure there is food in your stomach.  Works quick and is a life saver.
"I had 40 lb case of canned peaches fall on my upper back,neck,and head. and this is all they gave me for my pain. I am not able enjoy my life any more
"
"I had to take this after abscess drainage. I took it 1x daily with food. At night, I woke up feeling like I was having a heart attack (it was severe heartburn, a reaction to the medication). I stopped taking it after a few nights like this. Since then, I've suffered from moderate heartburn. "
"Naproxin helps my osteoarthritis. The only side effect that I have experienced is swelling in my lower legs, ankles and feet."
"I JUST STARTED THIS MED, IT EFFECTS WELL ........I DID'NT SEE  ANY SIDE EFFECTS YET.....BUT I HAVE MAJOR RELIEF"
"This treatment did not work at all, and i m seeing some of the side effects."
"Have been taking naproxen for about two weeks,just started to get a rash on my face and neck,I am not sure if is caused by the drug."
it stop my pain right away.
This medication really helped my rotator cuff injury in January and then again for Gout in May. I found it gave me relieve within a day. It's easy on my stomach as long as I take it with food.
  I have a stress-fracture on top of my right foot. My doctor prescribed a 500mg dosage. I became very tired...extremely nausiated....and rapid heartbeat. I'm scared to death of this pill!!!!!!!! I just about passed out!!!!!Beware....it should ne taken of the market!!!
only have had to use occasionally for moderate pain and have always had pain relief after only taking initial dose (2)
I fell and fractured my tail bone and they gave this to me for pain. IT SUCKS!!! It doesn't take any pain away at all. My doctor is crazy and I am stuck in tons of pain Because he won't help me.
"this medication made my blood sugar run high while taking it.
"
"Taking 1000 mg a day (2 x 500mg),  works well, my lower back pain has gone away.  So far no problems with stomach as long as i take it with food.  "
"I do not recommend taking this medicine long term. A family member depended on them after a car accident 9yrs ago that left her with constant back and leg pain. She started with signs of nose bleeds, dizziness, darkened stool/urine, kidney function issues, swelling of the ankles and feet and ultimately having a stroke! I urge anyone taking this drug to seriously follow up with your doctor. There are other more effective healing methods out there."
still have the abdominal pain
"Two year user at 1000mg daily for degenerative discs, fractured L1 and spinal stenosis.  Recently have problems with increased blood pressure and diabetic symptoms.  Withdrew drug awaiting lab results, and increased BP meds."
"I took it for lower back pain, and after a couple weeks, it made the palms of my hands itch.  They were also blotchy red.  I think I developed an allergy to it.  And it did't help the pain much. "
"Three weeks ago I fell 2X playing tennis and wrenched my shoulder, back and neck on one side.  I had a tennis tournament to play and was having alot of shoulder & back pain.  My arm hurt to lift it.  I took one 500 mg. of Naproxen that belonged to my husband.  I played the tennis tourney without a hitch and pain was completely gone for a full 24 hours.  Even 48 hours later, the pain is barely there.  Good stuff and no problems. I have a propensity for stomach problems, so I won't be taking any more Naproxen."
"I was instructed to take this twice a day in addition to Darvocet for severe low back pain. It helped significantly for the first two weeks, then, I developed a painful nosebleed that continued off-and-on for FOUR DAYS! My nostrils would crust up with scabs until it was difficult to breathe. I would put a Q-Tip in my nostril to make an airway, and the bleeding would immediately resume. I also started very heavy menstration in the middle of my (BC) pill pack. As soon as I stopped the Naproxen the unusual menstration stopped and so did the nosebleed. However I am grappling with nausea, diarrhea, SEVERE abdominal cramping, stomach upset, dry heaves, dizziness and lack of thirst and hunger, despite having horrible dry mouth and sore throat. I have also developed a small blister on my lip, on the same side as the nosebleeds were. This has been a living hell for me. I will NEVER take this medication again! I feel so sick! I always took it with food, as directed. I don't know why all this happened to me. I also have no history of bleeding or kidney issues."
"I have taken naprosin OTC for 2 and 1/2 months for hip pain.  My Dr. perscribed 250 mgs ""as needed""  for hip pain.  Naproxin never gave me any problems, but I always took it with food,  Naproxin was the only thing that helped my pain at all. 
But again it must be taken at the first sign of pain because it is very slow acting in my case,  I drove, and carried on with life as usual with no impairment or pain."
I started taking 500 mg 2 times a day for  tailbone pain .within a week almost all the joints in my body started hurting even my fingers would lock. I do work and hard but it wasnt normal for everything to hurt that bad so I stopped taking them and within 3 days pain went away. tried half a pill a week later for the other issue I have and the joint pain came right back....I will never take these again
Very pleased! After knee surgery I read about Naproxen and asked my doctor about the side affects.  The risk was minimal and safe when taken with food.  However eating before a dose caused some weight gain.  I recommend Naproxen to anyone not wanting the addictive nature of Vicodin for pain.   
DOES ANYONE KNOW if its okay to take this medication if you are allergic to sulfa drugs?? I am and I have kidney problems and I am afraid to start taking it for my broken back!! Please help me if you know!
after taking the medication for about a week on a daily basis (800-1200 mg per day) I developed a bleeding ulcer which put me in the hospital for three days. Very clear symptom of blood (black) in the stool.  I have always liked these class of drugs (NSAID) but now have to find other pain relief medications.  Cannot (will not) take these types ever again. 
"I had knee surgery and this did not help me at all. I always took  it with crackers , but one day I  vomited blood. that was the first time, and  the last time I  took the meds. Maybe this would not effect everyone like that, but, it did me. Many people I  know had no problms with  it. "
"Naproxen alleviates any pain as long as I catch the pain before it is full-blown.  Only 2 tablets relieve pain for 12+ hours; I never need to take another dose sooner than 12 hours.  If the pain is not great, I need only 1 tablet.  I always take this med with toast or crackers or other food and it never bothers my stomach or bowels."
This med did not stop my pain. fter taking for a week I've started bleeding with my bowel movements. I've stopped and bleeding stopped also.
pain went away within 1/2 hour 
"I have OA in both knees, this has helped me greatly, but be sure to eat a little something to keep from stomach upset.
I keep toast and/or applesauce handy."
This made me extremely dizzy and nauseous. I only took it for a few days but stopped after i couldn't function enough to work. It didn't help with the back pain at all so i'm very pissed about this drug. Caused me more problems then it should have. Definitely not going to take this again. 
"Took this medication for 3 days and it gave me a bad stomach ache, I always took with food and it still didnt work.  "
This medication stopped the stinging and burning in my arms and hands immediately.  I take it with food and have no problems.  It worked better for me than anything I have been given over the past 2 years.
I've been taking Naproxen for the last 6 months for lower back pain. It really has helped me. The only drawback is that it has caused me to have an ulcer. It works well for what it's supposed to but be careful.
itshelpsalittle
I have been using this drug for a month.  My hip pain is better but I have developed a blister on my lip.  Have any others had this problem?
does not help pain
"I started taking for low back pain about a month ago. I take one a day.   The pain is much less and now only a ""dull"" roar. My doctor has me take one Nexium an hour before I take Naproxen to counter any stomach problems.  He told me if I am going to be doing anything out of ordinary routine that may cause pain, such as long walks or riding my horse, I can take some Tylenol for Arthritis also."
i have some time of joint pain as yet undetermined. I have been using this drug for 5 days and i am very pleased with the results.  The pain is still slightly there but i am able to function much better than before.  i have not experienced any side effects.
WHEN TAKEN BEFORE BED I ALWAYS WAKE UP SOAKING WET.
Pain and inflamation medication
Used for lower back pain. Works just like it should.
I take 500mg twice a day and i'm till in pain.
"Have a sore toe (dropped an ironing board on it).  Black spot at base of toe nail, but no swelling.  Took 2 naproxen this morning and was able to function, but about 8 hrs. later, pain restarted.  Took another pill - with not much relief.  This was about 4 hrs. ago - can I take a couple of arthritis strength Tylenol or some aspirin now?"
"It was a great pain reliever, lasted a long time.  But, after about 2 or 3 days I started feeling sick to my stomach, had headaches, chest pains and shortness of breath. I have stopped taking 4 days ago, but can still feel the negative effects from this drug."
ok
I have been taking aleve for nearly two months under doctors orders for back pain. For the last week I have been experiencing increasly bad stomach pain and nausea. I'm very concerned. I plan on calling my doctor and have stopped taking the medication.
arthritis in back
I had surgery on my mouth the get my impacted wisdom teeth removed and they gave me this to help with the pain. All it did was force me to throw up and then knock me out. I felt worse and was in more pain when I was taking Naproxen than after i got rid of the rest of the pills. It is aweful.
"I have chronic lower back pain and have had many pain killers that work but upset my stomach such as vicodin. Got this as an ""easier"" medication but it doesnt seem to be strong enough and only lasts about 10 minutes"
Helpful in controlling lower back pain
still have pain
"I had a lot of stomach pain with this medication, even when taken with food. It didn't really give me much relief. The stomach pain was worse than the other pain I was taking the medication for. I had better relief with Aleve! Overall, this medication is not worth the money and is not worth putting into mine or anyone else's body."
"This medication worked wonderful until I took a second dose and found out I was allergic. I began having trouble breathing, my air way swelled and I began having severe vomiting. This happens when I take ANY anit-inflammatory or ibuprofen."
naproxen is being used for a opiate addiction for my daughter.  I was just told that this should not be used for this for it causes withdrawls more.  Please tell me is this true
Did not notice any noticeable relief from my back pain when using this drug. After 30 days discontinued using drug with my Dr's approval. I now use Tramadol instead which so far does work for me.
I was experiencing back pain so my Doctor prescribed this drug. My back pain went away but I had really bad stomach pain.
im not sure i think im gaining weight retaining water and im scared that it might make me sick do to having the gastric bypass any info for me would be helpful.
"I have severe back pain. This medication is the only med that has relieved my pain enough for me to function normally. No side effects yet. For those w/ stomach problems, this med is not intended to be used for long periods of time, it is in a classification called a NSAID, these meds can cause stomach ulcers. Be cautious of how long you use it and how often."
Still sick to my stomach after stop taking several days ago. Can anyone tell me how long it took for their stomach to stop hurting?
This medication is a great anti-inflamatory. The problem I had with this medication was that it gave me a slight headache and made my blood pressure too high.
500 mg twice daily. A miracle drug for my food pain. Zero side affects and pain free for 6 hours. With proper dosing has helped me greatly.
I had really bad shoulder pain and i took 500 mg twice a day to ease the pain... It never worked and now I have severe stomach pain from taking it.
"This medication should be taken off the market. For 2 years I was troubled with mouth sores and inflammation of the tongue,mouth,eyes,and throat. No one including disease specialist could figure out what was causing my breakouts. Went to Dr. after Dr. with no help.  My family Dr. had initially given me this medication for back pain, I occasionly had after working in the garden. I took 6 pills over a period of 2 1/2 years and I finally discovered the cause of my breakouts. I told my Dr. my theory when I went to him for a sinus infection in Feb/08 he advised me to wait until I was over the infection and then just take 1 Naproxen and see what happened.I took 1 pill on a Sat. about 4pm. within 2 hours my tongue started tingling. When I awoke the next morning my lips were 3x normal size, eyes were swollen shut look like I'd been in fight. Ulcers, blisters inside mouth that did not stop breaking out for 14 days and then another 14 days to clear up. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG! Not worth it. I'd rather suffer with back pain occasionally.  "
Did not work for me.
"Taking this I got all the side effects without any pain releif. I vomited, got drowsy, and lost my appitite, but barely any pain releif. It is meant to last for 8-12 hours, it never worked more then 2-4 for me. I ended up asking my doctor to switch meds."
didnt think it worked for me
JUST STARTED TAKING THIS MEDICINE LAST NIGHT  I SLEPT ALL NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS WOKE UP WITH NO PAIN IN MY HAND USED MY HAND ALL DAY WITH NO PAIN NOW PAIN IS BACK AND I TOOK A SECOND PILL. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF IT WORKS AGAIN TONIGHT
I HAD SEVERE STOMACH/ABD. PAIN.
" worked well first six months for severe shoulder/neck pain, than landed me in ER with allergic reaction - pay attention to those possible side effects!  They occurred without warning and now I can no longer use it. Not worth it and seeking alternative pain relief. "
I just started taking naproxen for chipped bone in ankle not sure how it's working so far still feel hot pain in ankle after taking for two days 500mg twice a day need to go see a ortho dr.
i just started using it for pain
"I take this for stress-related neck and shoulder pain that leads to massive headaches when untreated.  This is the first drug that has consistently managed my pain, and I've had no side-effects. "
"Recently had severe bout of abdominal pain and frank bleeding and clots from my descending colon, about a foot long.  Lost a lot of blood and Hgb went from 11.4 to 9.3.  Took 2 weeks to get condition under control.
Still taking Naproxen for hip, knee, ankle and foot pain from Arthritis or neuropathy.
Dr. Thought bleeding and inflammation came from vessel being cut off to the bowel.  I thought it was from adhesions.  Now I read that it could be from the Naproxen.  Still having bloating, difficulty moving bowels and some discomfort."
"I had back pain, upon taking 500mgs in am and pm, my neck stiffed  right soulder feels numb and like somthing burning inside, causing more pain. I stopped taking it, because it did nothing to me but more pain and problems"
I have been diagnosed with runners knee and was prescribed this medication for the pain. My pain did not decrease at all and actually seemed to get worse and within the first week I had gained five pounds of water weight visibly.
Seemed to provoke an increase in pain
"Dulled my tailbone pain but gave me serious gastric distress and cramping. I'm not sure what is worse. I hope when I'm off this, that my tailbone continues to not hurt or this wasn't worth it."
"This medication did not work at all for me, I shattered my leg 2 years ago..."
"I have osteoarthritis.  After knee replacement in 2002 I took Vioxx and Hydrocodone every am and pm.  When Vioxx was taken off the market, my doctor prescribed Naproxen only, 500 mg am and pm.  It just does NOT relieve the pain and some days I am very weak and can hardly walk.  But if I add Tylenol for Arthritis, my stomach hurts.  Very discouraging.  BTW my knee is fine - it is my hips and shoulders that hurt."
it did not work as well for me i was still in pain and had to try something else
didn't do a thing for me i have back problems and am in the begining stages of treatment
"Works great for my Sciatica and really bad menstrual pain.  Just gave me an upset stomach, but the pain is completely gone!"

I HAVE ONLY BEEN TAKING FOR ABOUT A WEEK .IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR ME.
"I have Lymphedema in both legs and upon taking 500mgs in am and pm, both legs swelled more and more, causing more pain.   I stopped taking it, and the increased swelling is going away.  I will NEVER take this drug again."
